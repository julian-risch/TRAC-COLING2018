Now the people of the state of J & K are in the excitement and they have been misled by infiltrators. For the past 10 days, I have received thousands of replies from state officials and some representatives of the Pakistani people, whose thesis I wrote, about intolerance in the state of Japan. .

Here, some people depend on terrorist organizations and Pakistani militants and other anti-national elements. Now they are rocking the army and the police, and they have brandished slogans in favor of anti-nationalism and wearing ISIS robes and Pakistani flags.

J & K State students must be admitted to the South Indian Collages because there is no mutual understanding and interaction between the J & K State and the Southern States. In my verdict, it is the great salvation of intolerance.

Need marriage proposals between the South and the North with the people of the state j & k.

J & K State suffers from Lobour Acts and implementations because there is no road map to survive with good opportunities this is the major problem in J & K State that's why teenagers are following an illegal act.

Need Industrial Hub in J & K state for better earnings.

I ask Prime Minister Ji MODI that, please bring the new reforms to j & k state for a better future to our citizens .... Jai Hind

"Doucett Black. Your atheism has no place in this Christian nation in which you live.

Before wasting time demolishing the illusion of ""separation of Church and State"", let us consider the words of James Madison, the father of our constitution:

""We have staked all of our political institutions on humanity's ability to govern itself, on the ability of each of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to support us according to the Ten Commandments of God.""

The man who wrote our Constitution left no room for doubt to govern us according to the Ten Commandments of God. Congress records Christianity as the established religion of these United States of America:

The drafting process of the First Amendment made the intentions of the Founders abundantly clear; Before approving the final wording, the First Amendment had a dozen different iterations and lengthy discussions.

""We do not want in America what we had in Britain: we do not want a denomination to lead the Nation, we will not all be Catholics, nor Anglicans, nor any other denomination, we want the principles of God, but we do not want a denomination to lead the nation. ""

This intention has been well understood, as evidenced by the decisions of the courts after the First Amendment. In 1799, the court declared: ""By our form of government, the Christian religion is the established religion; and all sects and denominations of Christians are placed on the same footing. ""

The American Almanac, while a respected publication, is not the ultimate authority. Our founding fathers, speaking through the American Constitution, hold such authority. Their position on the subjects in question is indeed confirmed by the supreme law of the country, as evidenced by the United States Supreme Court. Maybe you are ""stupid"" and need to educate yourself?",OAG

"This budget says loud and clear that DEMONTISATION was a wet squib. If tax concessions are granted, there will be a loss of revenue for the government. Unless there are ways to repair this loss, concessions can not be granted. If demonetization had succeeded in curbing black money, the Govt. would have had additional income to allow the concession in personal taxation. Since the concession in this score is nominal, or even negative, given the inflation, it is written on the face of the EU budget, 2017, that there is very little success in reducing the money black by demonetization. On the other hand govt. need money for several wellness programs and specific sources to collect this money. Since independence, the salaried class is the most certain source of tax revenue and therefore govt. decided to take him for a ride for another time. People who have been happy to think that the dishonest wealth of dishonest people in their neighborhood would now be caught, are probably still not aware of it. If they are always happy to see the budget analysis on television and think that this budget is a good boost for the rural sector and infrastructure, here is a statistic.

Dear Indian,
I'm sorry to write that your reporters are there to misinterpret the events and present them in a distorted way just to make sensational headlines.

For a moment, I was stunned. Perhaps like many of his passionate followers. Why would BJP commit a harakiri, upset a minority, provide a way for part of the media and the opposition to mount an attack with renewed vigor and jubilation (I told you so!). it undermines his reputation? ?
But knowing Modi and Amit Shah, their ability to think far ahead of the rest, I think they have a game plan with long-range consequences that will bring them rich dividends in the electoral battles down the line.
Suppose they ensure for the next 2 years a splendid governance model with high growth and peace coupled with an impartial administration, they bury the ghost and ""communal"" etiquette neutralize and silence the critics once for all! If the right-wing ""monster"" epitome can make this paradigm shift, then it will succeed in wooing minorities into their fold, which they have not been able to do so far.
More media are concerned about the negative aspects, more support from BJP will be great, because the credibility of the media is at its height through dynamic social media.",CAG

"Respected Mr. Law MINISTER
Please ensure that it is appropriate to initiate a redress of outstanding grievances.
My life with the family as an Er. The contractors were spoiled because of dubious actions by vengeful officials of the corrupted ISI, SBI, KFC, and so on.
From 1982 to 1997, they played with my life as an SSI unit owner.
In 1990, I tried justice with the ISI and the SBI through the Kerala State Consumer Dispute Resolution Commission, and in 1992 an appeal was filed with the National CDRC, with both Commissions having judicial and non-judicial. I did not have a lawyer to pursue my fate. All members of both Commissions realized the truth, but with the help of the LIMITATION Act. But my inexperience and my obligation to the system, I am silent and I continue efforts to revive and rehabilitate my SSI SSI unit with the full cooperation of the Department of Industries.
On 7.7.1995, I paid KFC the single settlement in the spirit of KFC's letter of 23.6.95. But my inability to satisfy corrupt officials, the unit taken over by the Revenue Recovery Act on 30.5.95 was kept with KFC custody.
I was at KFC headquarters, Trivandrum after my OTS payment, until a road accident in Palauan over Trivandrum on 6.3.97.
I was under treatment at Trivandrum Medical College, Kannur District Hospital, Mangalore Municipal Hospital, and so on. At least in 1997, I visited KFC HO with the help of Crutches and found that the water was flowing. visit the Kerala State CDRC and will soon be filing a lawsuit against KFC. After three months, the Council received a response from KFC with a copy to me. On the basis of KFC's response, the Commission began to dictate the judgment and dismiss my complaint against Sue in the civil court.
The next day, I filed a petition for review in addition to a few others. On the day of the hearing, when I got up with the help of Crutches and began to express my point of view, the President of the Commission threatened to order huge costs against me. I managed to escape the so-called Consumer Court with fear.
But I know that anyone with common sense will do me justice on behalf of the National and State CDRC in both cases.
After, from 1977 to 2009, I was under acute mental depression.
I started writing to central and regional governments and thus passed 5 GO pages, in 2010 direct KFC to fix problems at the Council level and write to the various ministries of the Government of India to inform me and compensate because of doubtful actions of the ISI and SBI.
But my efforts still continue, corrupt officials also continue to resist my efforts at my 67th age.
What we understand from the synopsis of the situation
Officials have a good salary and support from all government executives to rescue the corrupt with the support of so-called Provision in judicial and quasi-judicial tribunals, such as the CDRC, the Human Rights Commissions, etc.

My fate is covered by Malayalam Manorama, The Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc. and are on my face book account.
Should I wait for prompt justice from the authorities concerned in my last days and who will effectively inform the formation of new security measures at independent meetings and prevent such bad experiences from suffering on my part and my family.

Dear Indian,
I'm sorry to write that your reporters are there to misinterpret the events and present them in a distorted way just to make sensational headlines. The news about future singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and call.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified lawyer (Mufti) at the request of a person who does not understand the religious guidelines while the booklet that is distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a paper copy an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed on many points and in many dimensions, but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

Dear Indian,
I'm sorry to write that your reporters are there to misinterpret the events and present them in a distorted way just to make sensational headlines. The news about future singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and call.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified lawyer (Mufti) at the request of a person who does not understand the religious guidelines while the booklet that is distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a paper copy an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed on many points and in many dimensions, but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"Margaux S Milchen.The Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the United States of America and the Bey and the Tripoli of Barbary, signed in Tripoli on November 4, 1796, Article 11 was established as a dispute between the English and Arabic translations of the treaty. Adams criticized the claims to universal authority made by the Roman Catholic Church, which may well be the basis for the wording of Article 11.

While Adams signed the aforementioned Treaty, it should be noted that it also signed the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights; both serve to further support Adams' words as misinterpreted. That the Congress unanimously signed the Treaty is absurd when we recognize the whole question of translation.

John Adams was both a pious Christian and an independent thinker. In a letter to Benjamin Rush, Adams attributes religion to the success of his ancestors since their migration to the New World in the 1630s. He also believed that regular religious service was beneficial to the moral sense of man. In 1796, Adams denounced the deist critics of political opponent Thomas Paine on Christianity in The Age of Reason, saying: ""The Christian religion is, first and foremost, the religion of wisdom, virtue and fairness and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he wants.

In the light of Adams' Christianity, it is highly unlikely that the translations from English to Arabic were accurately transcribed. It is much more plausible that he rejected the pretensions of ""universal authority"" proclaimed by the Roman Catholic Church than anything that removes at a distance the foundation of the Christian religion.

Adams served twice as vice president under President George Washington. The words of our esteemed first president, included in his farewell speech, still dispute any idea that these United States of America are not based on the Christian religion; ""And with caution, let us admit that morality can be maintained without religion.Everything that can be conceded to the influence of refined education on the minds of a particular structure, reason, and experience forbids us both. to wait for national morality to prevail in the exclusion of the religious principle.

The words of James Madison, the father of our constitution, clearly contradict the idea that America is not a Christian nation; ""We have staked all of our political institutions on humanity's ability to govern itself, on the ability of each of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to support us according to the Ten Commandments of God.""

While Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States, they have not yet won the state. Aboriginal languages ‚Äã‚Äãhave not yet taken precedence over the English language in any of our states. Your argument is a dubious point until they win said state. We are all very aware that the United States is not Israel; it is absurd to repeat the obvious, especially when it is not relevant at the moment. Maybe it's you who ""should read more?""",NAG

"What you need to know about the President of Turkey, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 led to a 64% growth in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $ 23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new agreement. Turkey's debt to the IMF was declared fully paid and it announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, Turkey's five-year credit default swaps traded at a record low of 1.17%, lower than that of nine EU member states and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish central bank had reserves of $ 26.5 billion. This amount reached $ 92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's term. Inflation rose from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.

Under the Erdoƒüan government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, 13500 km of motorways were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high-speed rail lines were built and the country's high-speed rail service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railways have been built and 5449 km of renewed railways.

Erdogan has invested more in the health system than any other predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which offers free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan has increased spending on education from 7.5 billion lire in 2002 to 34 billion in 2011, the largest share of the national budget allocated to a ministry, and the number of universities in Turkey having almost doubled from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

In 1996 $ 1 = 222 lire and in 2016 1 $ = 2.94 lire, even after the recent turmoil.",NAG

If by ""appeasement"" you mean the appeasement to mulism.
Which are the most backward sections in this country.
The reason is you asking? Communal prejudices, Ghettoisation, Repeated persecution.
Just for your information, Muslims are even more backward than Dalits, SC, ST even the non-Hindu SC / ST (Tribal). In fact, the backward, poorest and ghettoised community of India is Muslim.
When the questions of these communities are bought in parliament, no one opposes them.Ex Jat, Patel, Tamil, SC, Dalit, Zoroastrian, Sikh, but if you talk about the conditions of Indian citizens who happen to be Muslim then his appeasement which constitute 14.2% of the population of India.",CAG

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian,
I'm sorry to write that your reporters are there to misinterpret the events and present them in a distorted way just to make sensational headlines. The news about future singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and call.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified lawyer (Mufti) at the request of a person who does not understand the religious guidelines while the booklet that is distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a paper copy an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed on many points and in many dimensions, but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"I would like to mention here that about a month ago, I bought a Vitara Breeza ZDI car from One-up engines (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow - 226005, Vehicle registration UP 32 HQ 5615.

In the days that followed the delivery of the car, I noticed some messy parts and bubbles on the driver's and co-driver's door. Then I spoke to the car dealership about the problem, they noticed the problem and sent my car to their Maruti Suzuki petrol station on 02-01-2017 for fixing the problem.

After 15 days, the same problem has occurred again. When I took my car to the dealership (One-up engines (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow-226005), they sent it to the service station for rectification problems and delivered the car after two days.

The same problem was again noticed on 13-02-2017. After only 20 more days, that is 24-02-17, the same problem was noticed all over the body of the car.

When I visit the dealer's authorized service station, they refuse to solve the problem and misbehave with me.

Today is 23.03.2017 My car is still being repaired at Oneup Moters Arambagh for the last 20 days.

I brought the car for use my old parents and not to send it to the service station repeatedly for repairs or repair problems. My father suffers from heart problems. As you know, it is very difficult for the elderly or to visit the service station several times.",NAG

Pork is banned in all but three Islamic countries. Muslim extremists say that other religions are intolerant of them and have always been victims of INJUSTICE AND HATE. Maybe true, but a very logical justification for this can be deduced by linking the points above as well as below ...

"Why India should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty
The Indus Water Treaty is illegal
The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 was signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ""nowhere is it said that the said agreement / treaty was signed on behalf of the President of India"" ,
""According to documents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, no disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India ...""

""According to the disputed agreement, 80% of the water goes to Pakistan, which constitutes a serious infringement of the fundamental right of the citizens of India, associated with new financial and natural attacks on the national interest.""

If we Indians continue to give up today, our future generations will want and will never forgive us

India must be like China fast and furious and must have the ability to say on the face.
China Claim the South China Sea
China has made and develops 7 artificial islands made on the South China Sea so quickly
So why India can not stop the water of our own states and territories of the Union of India
We need to build more dam on the Indus River and have to have Iccha-Shakti to say one sentence to the World Bank F * ck Off
India treats Indus water treaty

If China can do for their mother earth
So why not India (if India can not do it)
Then theirs is a serious problem in our system of Indian government with our political parties and also with our useless politician.
Who knows just barking but can not take action.

"How to convert all your black money into white in 4 perfectly ""legal"" easy steps?
Reply:-
-> Step 1 - Create a political party, and be registered under People's Act Representation, 1951. [Not a difficult task. There are more than 1,000 registered parties that have not even contested Lok Sabha's election in 2014, and EC can not write off a party]
-> Step 2 - Give all your black money to your party in parties, each party should be less than 20,000. You can make infinite donations, and say they come from people.
[According to the 1951 Law on PR, political parties are not required to declare (to the Indian Electoral Commission) the names of individuals or organizations to whom they have received donations of less than 20,000 Rs.]
-> Step 3 - Go to the bank, deposit all that amount into the party's account.
[No need to pay income tax. Political parties are 100% exempt from income tax
-> Step 4 - Remove the amount as and when your needs, in 50/100/500/2000 rupees - Everything is white.
[Since political parties are not under RTI, you can not ask them how they spent their money]
ENJOY YOUR WEALTH ... !!!!
* Moral of the story: - All political parties are the same. All they do is follow the letter of law as in the example above and kill the spirit that is politically correct but ethically incorrect. But in the process you will learn how one can legally generate enormous wealth and still talk about ideals and concerns for the poor.

Dear Indian,
I'm sorry to write that your reporters are there to misinterpret the events and present them in a distorted way just to make sensational headlines. The news about future singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and call.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified lawyer (Mufti) at the request of a person who does not understand the religious guidelines while the booklet that is distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a paper copy an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed on many points and in many dimensions, but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"Pigeral: If you have problems with Muslim Azan, you must also have problems with Hindu Aarti. Both cause noise pollution.

Agniveer: There is a difference.

1. How many times did you wake up at 4:30 in the morning because of the noise of the Hindu Aarti in the temples? Zero.

How many times did you wake up at 4:30 in the morning because of the noise of Azan in mosques? 365 times a year (if you live within 5 km of a mosque).

Zero vs 365 rules everything.

Even if the Aarti speaker in your community starts at 4:30 in full volume, you can simply go to the priest and he will reduce it. Try to do it with a Moulvi in ‚Äã‚Äãa mosque and see if you come back in one piece.

Pigeral: Huh, and what about your Ganesh Yatra, Hanuman Yatra? Do not they make noise? Stop them.

Agnivore: How many times a year do Ganesh Chaturthi and Hanuman Jayanti come?

Pigeral: At least 10 days.

Agniveer: And how many times does Azan arrive in the loudspeaker in a year?

Pigeral:

Agniveer: Why silence? Let me help you. 365 * 5 = 1825. And besides, there are rallies, bicycle acrobatics, processions, and so on. on B'Day of the Prophet, Eid and Muharram etc.

So it's 10 vs 1825+. Are 10 and 1825 the same?

Pigeral: Bad is wrong. There is no harm greater or smaller.

Agniveer: Ok, your waist size 34/36/38 is also wrong. Come train before commenting on our concerns about Azan.

Pigeral: How can you compare my fitness problem with a 20% minority problem?

Agniveer: In the same way that you compared 10 with 1825+.

Pigeral:

Agniveer: Why silence?

Pigeral: Look, you can not interfere in the religion of others. India is a multicultural society. Every religion has equal rights.

Agniveer: Equal Rights? Do we have equal rights? A Muslim can marry 4 women at a time and divorce them at will. A Hindu is imprisoned for doing the same. Where are the equal rights? And where are the equal rights for Muslim women? You just need equal noise rights. And you do not care about the situation of the 10 Muslim women crore?

Look, equal rights come with equal responsibilities. You follow equal laws, you will have equal rights. You act like a special hero, your $$ will be kicked.

And finally, there is another solid difference. There is a strong correlation between Azan's density and terror. Discover the places on earth where

1. Azan is maximum (let's call it Place 1)
2. Aarti is maximum (let's call it Place 2)

Next, find out how many terrorists and terrorist organizations in the world are in Groups 1 and 2. This is the ultimate litmus test on which noise is dangerous and harmless.

Pigeral:

Agniveer: Why silence?

Pigeral: Who are you male?

Agniveer: A proud Hindu. A fervent worshiper of idols. A proud Jihadi-hater. A proud Indian. Agniveer is the name.

Dear Indian,
I'm sorry to write that your reporters are there to misinterpret the events and present them in a distorted way just to make sensational headlines.

It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and call.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified lawyer (Mufti) at the request of a person who does not understand the religious guidelines while the booklet that is distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a paper copy an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed on many points and in many dimensions, but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian,
I'm sorry to write that your reporters are there to misinterpret the events and present them in a distorted way just to make sensational headlines. The news about future singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and call.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified lawyer (Mufti) at the request of a person who does not understand the religious guidelines while the booklet that is distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a paper copy an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed on many points and in many dimensions, but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).
We are waiting for an apology from you for such an error.",CAG

"1984 SIKH GENOCIDE

THE VERDICT DELIVERED IN THE AFFAIR NARODA PATIYA IN THE FORMER ANTI-MUSLIM GUJARAT OF 2002 IS WELCOME, BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE SIKH GENOCIDE OF I984 WHO ARRIVED AFTER THE ASSASSINATION OF THE INDIAN PRIME MINISTER INDIRA GANDHI BY HIS 2 BODIES FROM SIKH RETIRED FOR BLUESTAR OPERATION, JUSTICE IS STILL TO BE DELIVERED. Although Indira Gandhi has been rated by you among the greatest Indians, but I do not think she has done anything great to be on this list. We Sikhs do not hold it in high esteem. HOW CAN YOU CALL A GREAT INDIAN WHEN IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NON-COUNTED DEATHS OF THOUSANDS OF SIKHS INNOCENTS WHO ARE A MINORITY COMMUNITY? She has only created Bhindranwale to counter the Akalis in Punjab and is responsible for the rise of religious extremism in the state. BEFORE THERE WAS NO RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM IN PUNJAB. Even after his death, 20,000 Sikhs were murdered throughout India (4,000 in Delhi alone) from October 31 to November 4, 1984 in a cold-blooded genocide led by the SECULAR CONRESS PARTY OF INDIA. Sikhs were burned alive in front of their families, women were raped as a group and their belongings were set on fire. The crowds laughed while killing the Sikhs. The thugs were led by the local congressional MPS with Govt's electoral lists in their hands to help them find Sikh homes and properties and urged non-Sikhs to kill as many Sikhs as possible. The local congressmen even gave money to the rioters, telling them that the person who would kill the maximum number of Sikhs would get the biggest share out of the other incentives. From October 31 to November 3, blood cries of ""KHOON KA BADLA KHOON LENGE - WE WIN THE BLOOD"" were broadcast on Delhi Doordarshan and even the famous Bollywood actor Amitabh Bacchan was inciting people to kill Sikhs. The Congress was in power at the time of the riots, and PVNarasimha Rao was the Minister of the Interior, but he did nothing before November 2, despite his knowledge of the carnage and the Delhi police were content with silent spectators instead to protect the Sikhs. & let the bloody carnage continue as directed by their political masters. Most of the senior police officers deliberately took leave from November 1 to 3 on the orders of their political masters. The army was not deliberately called and only told to come in the evening of November 2nd, but there was still no one to guide them. through the streets of Delhi. Then, on the 3rd of November, after their quench for the blood was satisfied, as if it were at a distance, everything stopped. It was a cold-blooded genocide led by leading congressional politicians against the Sikhs. If swift action had been taken on the first day of the riots, this genocide would never have occurred. IT IS SERIOUS FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY THAT THE PERPETRATORS OF THE 1984 SIKH GENOCIDE HAVE NOT YET STOPPED NOR ANY APPROPRIATE LEGAL CONVICTION AGAINST A SINGLE PERSON, IN RESPECT OF THE MULTIPLE CONVICTIONS IN POST GODHRA'S RIOTS. 2002 WHO ARRIVED LATER PLEASURES REPEATED BY THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIM.
Killers and murderers are wandering and some are even ministers in the government congress. NO APPROPRIATE REMUNERATION WAS PAID TO VICTIMS OF THE 84 RIOTS, AND HAS NO APPROPRIATE APOLOGY OR NO MEMORIAL BUILT IN THEIR MEMORY BY THE GOVERNMENT. UNLESS THE PERPETRATORS OF THESE HEINOUS CRIMES ARE BEING BOOKED, I WILL NOT BE SURPRISED IF THIS CARNAGE IS REPEATED AGAIN. THE GOVT CONGRESS IS ALWAYS DISCLAIMED BY THIS BLOOD CARNAGE AS MANY OF THEIR SENIOR MINISTERS ARE INVOLVED IN THIS GENOCIDE AND AFTER DELIVERING HALTED HEARTED APOLOGIES WHEN IT HAS BEEN PRACTICAL FOR THEM, THEY HAVE NOT DONE EVERYTHING. THEY HOPE AGAINST HOPE THAT WHILE LIVING IN THE DENIAL, THEY MAY MAKE PEOPLE FORGET THIS PHASE OF DIFFICULT HISTORY, BUT THEY ARE MUCH BAD AS THE HISTORY DOES NOT OPEN. UNLESS THE CUTTERS ARE DEPOSITED TO RESERVE, IT WILL RESULT IN A VERY FRESH AND COLD GENERATION OF DRUGS AND VIOLENCE.",OAG

"(Photo of the representative) Thiruvananthapuram: According to an intelligence report submitted to the chief of police seven months ago and consulted by TOI, two ""recognized"" religious conversion centers in Kozhikode and Malappuram have converted up to 5,793 people into Islam between 2011 and 2015. Conversions that occur in unrecognized centers of the state could be much higher, fear senior officials who, for obvious reasons, do not want to be named. The report indicates that nearly half of those who converted to Islam are women and the majority of these women (76%) are under 35 years of age. Of those who were converted, 4,719 were Hindu and the remaining 1,074 were mostly Christians. The conversions took place at Tharbiyathul Islam Sabha in Kozhikode and Monunsthil Islam Sabha in Ponnani, two traditional religious institutions of the state ""authorized"" to convert people of other religions to Islam. The police report, prepared in connection with the conversion of Nimisha alias Fathima - currently missing with 20 others from the state and suspected of having joined the Islamic State - indicates that a detailed investigation is needed to verify if these conversions were under duress, were attracted or volunteered. ""Investigations are needed to find out if this will affect community harmony, the internal security of the state and the nation. A detailed investigation SSB (Special State Branch) in Kasaragod, Kannur, Alappuzha, Thiruvananthapuram and Palakkad is recommended to dig up the details, ""the report, sent by Kasaragod SP, to Srinivas, who investigated the Nimisha case in November 2015.

"Dear all,

Thank you for your support.

Please note our last event with the FIA ‚Äã‚Äãin Washington DC.

With confidence,
Dr. A Monica Dorhoi
President of the IMF Staff Meditation Club of the World Bank
in Washington DC

[Update] The Meditation Club meets the International Automobile Federation (FIA) Foundation Monday, January 11, 2016

Just in time ... Thank you for inviting us, Foundation of the International Federation of the Automobile (FIA) Monday, January 11, 2016

Dr. Dorhoi attended Monday, January 11, 2016 at the International Automobile Foundation (FIA) reception at the Marriott Marquis in Washington DC. She previously worked for more than 7 years funding road rehabilitation worldwide. Dr. Dorhoi also works on both financing and risk management in Formula 1 under the different funding requirements.

Thanks to the Foundation of the International Automobile Federation (FIA) for preparing and disseminating the progress made in the implementation of the objectives set by the ""United Nations Road Safety 2015"". The report was prepared by the World Health Organization.

At the event, the book ""Goals for Change, Partners for Action"" was also featured in the 2015 Annual Report of the International Automobile Federation (FIA) Foundation.

The report enthusiastically embraces the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. To be more specific, the energy goals for development translate into a global fuel economy initiative in which the foundation helps governments develop global and regional programs, find evidence of effectiveness at the national and local levels and to bring donors to national policies and initiatives.

In the United States, approximately 40% of traffic-related deaths have been reduced in recent years. The 2020 United Nations Millennium Road Safety Target aims to reduce traffic deaths by 50 per cent compared to today's numbers.

For Dr. Dorhoi, the link with the International Automobile Federation (FIA) Foundation is blessed by his long-time dedication to the causes of Ayrton Senna. The International Automobile Federation (FIA) is the organizer of the Formula 1 championships and Ms. Dorhoi, an American living in Washington DC for 15 years, has been a great supporter for more than two decades. Dr. Dorhoi is one of the biggest fans of Ayrton Senna, a beloved Formula 1 driver who died in 1994 in San Marino. ""The tragedy really marked me in an undeniable way.""

Dr. Dorhoi is also grateful to Alan Prost of France and Williams Renault for sportsmanship after the loss of the Ayrton Senna driver.

[Additional Information: Updated press release was disclosed at the event venue.]

In our opinion, we are on the brink of a global meltdown and there will be a cyclical recession in the 2016-2018 period.

Global events that will exacerbate the recession:

- The IMF's foreign exchange reserve basket adds the Chinese yuan to its Forex basket, reducing the contribution of the euro to this basket by 7% +
- The euro will depreciate considerably
- BREXIT - British voters will vote for Britain to leave the EU
- The American elections and its uncertainty.
- Crude oil glut
- China Debt conversion into shares
- Shemitah year of 2016

A major global sale should have taken place on October 2, 2016 but as it is a Sunday October 3, 2016, which is a Monday, we will see a global sale and the global markets will correct more than 8% +

Dear Indian,
I'm sorry to write that your reporters are there to misinterpret the events and present them in a distorted way just to make sensational headlines. The news about future singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and call.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified lawyer (Mufti) at the request of a person who does not understand the religious guidelines while the booklet that is distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a paper copy an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed on many points and in many dimensions, but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

Many of these talented people left our country because they did not find the right environment in our country to feed their interest or their talent.

"Why India should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty
The Indus Water Treaty is illegal
The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 was signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ""nowhere is it said that the said agreement / treaty was signed on behalf of the President of India"" ,
""According to documents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, no disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India ...""

""According to the disputed agreement, 80% of the water goes to Pakistan, which constitutes a serious infringement of the fundamental right of the citizens of India, associated with new financial and natural attacks on the national interest.""

If we Indians continue to give up today, our future generations will want and will never forgive us

India must be like China fast and furious and must have the ability to say on the face.
China Claim the South China Sea
China has made and develops 7 artificial islands made on the South China Sea so quickly
So why India can not stop the water of our own states and territories of the Union of India
We need to build more dam on the Indus River and have to have Iccha-Shakti to say one sentence to the World Bank F * ck Off
India treats Indus water treaty

If China can do for their mother earth
So why not India (if India can not do it)

"ARUNACHAL PRADESH, INDIA - HIDDEN GATEWAY FOR CHINA'S NEED FOR A GLOBAL SUSTAINABLE RIVER WATER TRANSPORT SYSTEM
=================================

Arunachal Pradesh of India, the land of the rising sun, queen of undisputed beauty of nature and hydroelectric power station has always been a bone of contention between India and China.

But why is China so happy to have Arunachal Pradesh as part of Tibet? Is it simply a roguish or geopolitical or militaristic or expansionist state of mind of China? Why is China playing a zero-sum game knowing full well that India will not leave Arunachal Pradesh at any cost?

It is without a doubt clear to everyone that the BASIC GROWTH ENGINE of China's economy has been the SUSTAINABLE RIPARIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEM which has two components as LOCAL and GLOBAL characteristics.

It is the GLOBAL CHARACTERISTIC that makes ARUNACHAL PRADESH of India via NAGALAND as the gateway for China to the shortest RIVER KALADIN-based transport system from MYANMAR to BENGAL BAY (by the Sittwe seaport of Myanmar which will form finally KOLKATA-DHAKA-SITTWE economic corridor fueled by ""MULTILATERAL HIGHWAY BANGLADESH-BHUTAN-INDIA-NEPAL"" in conjunction with INDIA-MYANMAR-THAILAND TRILATERAL HIGHWAY thus effectively replacing NORTH-EAST INDIA as HUB of ACT POLITICAL IS OF THE INDIA with BENGAL, INDIA) as a transport system takes too much time and distance to cover. That is why CHINA continues to dispute the ARUNACHAL PRADESH, which gives India much irritation and prevents the two powers from achieving mutual prosperity.

But this game ZERO-SUM can be reversed by MIGHTY RIVER BRAHMAPUTRA. Having the RORO facilities at DHUBURI and elevated the status of DHUBURI, ASSAM, INDIA to the status of INTERNATIONAL SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE, the Brahmaputra of the rivers can provide a peaceful and sustainable riparian solution to the problem discussed above and for this the Government of the India and China's economic corridor fueled by domestic, road and rail networks (shipping both Bangladesh and Bhutan), namely ""DHAKA-DHUBURI-THIMPHU-LHASA-BEIJING ECONOMIC CORRIDOR (DDTLB)"".",CAG

Sometimes it's a group; grandmother, grandfather, mom and dad; then each of them is able to do other things while spending part of the day with the child. Sometimes both parents share responsibility. Sometimes, one parent gives priority to work and the other is a full-time caregiver. Sometimes you hire reliable help. No configuration is wrong. Economic factors also play a role in the decision.

In the words of former governor RBi Subbu Rao ""up 15 percent per year since fiscal year 2015/16, significantly faster than the trend rate of 10.7 percent over the previous three years."" This increase in the demand for money suggested that other dynamics were at stake. The surprise decision of the government was clearly aimed at responding to this unusual expansion of the currency in circulation, which is clearly out of step with This trend would be definitively stopped if the government is serious and continues its efforts sincerely.And the economy could see much less cash in circulation.2) A temporary compression of liquidity pushes a lot of people to switch to e-payments Convenience and efficiency will make them stay away from money permanently every time 3) With much less cash in circulation, black money locked in the land and gold would not be easily convertible into cash. This could reduce illegal activities also 4) Lower prices of land and apartments would benefit the economy eventually 5) All 12lakh crore reported to be handed over in the banking system has left a trail.

"Dear Indian,
I'm sorry to write that your reporters are there to misinterpret the events and present them in a distorted way just to make sensational headlines. The news about future singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and call.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified lawyer (Mufti) at the request of a person who does not understand the religious guidelines while the booklet that is distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a paper copy an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed on many points and in many dimensions, but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

What you need to know about the President of Turkey, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 led to a 64% growth in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $ 23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new agreement. Turkey's debt to the IMF was declared fully paid and it announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, Turkey's five-year credit default swaps traded at a record low of 1.17%, lower than that of nine EU member states and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish central bank had reserves of $ 26.5 billion. This amount reached $ 92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's term. Inflation rose from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.

Under the Erdoƒüan government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, 13500 km of motorways were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high-speed rail lines were built and the country's high-speed rail service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railways have been built and 5449 km of renewed railways.

Erdogan has invested more in the health system than any other predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which offers free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan has increased spending on education from 7.5 billion lire in 2002 to 34 billion in 2011, the largest share of the national budget allocated to a ministry, and the number of universities in Turkey having almost doubled from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

"My life with the family as an Er. The contractors were spoiled because of dubious actions by vengeful officials of the corrupted ISI, SBI, KFC, and so on.
From 1982 to 1997, they played with my life as an SSI unit owner.
In 1990, I tried justice with the ISI and the SBI through the Kerala State Consumer Dispute Resolution Commission, and in 1992 an appeal was filed with the National CDRC, with both Commissions having judicial and non-judicial. I did not have a lawyer to pursue my fate. All members of both Commissions realized the truth, but with the help of the LIMITATION Act. But my inexperience and my obligation to the system, I am silent and I continue efforts to revive and rehabilitate my SSI SSI unit with the full cooperation of the Department of Industries.
On 7.7.1995, I paid KFC the single settlement in the spirit of KFC's letter of 23.6.95. But my inability to satisfy corrupt officials, the unit taken over by the Revenue Recovery Act on 30.5.95 was kept with KFC custody.
I was at KFC headquarters, Trivandrum after my OTS payment, until a road accident in Palauan over Trivandrum on 6.3.97.
I was under treatment at Trivandrum Medical College, Kannur District Hospital, Mangalore Municipal Hospital, and so on. At least in 1997, I visited KFC HO with the help of Crutches and found that the water was flowing. visit the Kerala State CDRC and will soon be filing a lawsuit against KFC. After three months, the Council received a response from KFC with a copy to me. On the basis of KFC's response, the Commission began to dictate the judgment and dismiss my complaint against Sue in the civil court.
The next day, I filed a petition for review in addition to a few others. On the day of the hearing, when I got up with the help of Crutches and began to express my point of view, the President of the Commission threatened to order huge costs against me. I managed to escape the so-called Consumer Court with fear.
But I know that anyone with common sense will do me justice on behalf of the National and State CDRC in both cases.
After, from 1977 to 2009, I was under acute mental depression.
I started writing to central and regional governments and thus passed 5 GO pages, in 2010 direct KFC to fix problems at the Council level and write to the various ministries of the Government of India to inform me and compensate because of doubtful actions of the ISI and SBI.
But my efforts still continue, corrupt officials also continue to resist my efforts at my 67th age.
What we understand from the synopsis of the situation
Officials have a good salary and support from all government executives to rescue the corrupt with the support of so-called Provision in judicial and quasi-judicial tribunals, such as the CDRC, the Human Rights Commissions, etc.

My fate is covered by Malayalam Manorama, The Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc. and are on my face book account.
Should I wait for prompt justice from the authorities concerned in my last days and who will effectively inform the formation of new security measures at independent meetings and prevent such bad experiences from suffering on my part and my family.

"there. The Indian Army Group Performs at Drass WHEN IS WAR FIRED? The Kargil War, which began in May 1999, was announced after the infiltration of Pakistani troops and Kashmiri militants into the Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir and along the LOC. The intrusion into the region, which divided the Indian territory of Ladakh from the northern regions of the state, was a total surprise to the Indian army and Operation Vijay was immediately launched to drive our enemies from the Kargil area. Pakistani soldiers MASTERMIND BEHIND THE ATTACK Pervez Musharraf, the leader of Pakistan's army at the time, is considered the brain box behind the attack. Musharraf carefully traced the intrusion plan, without any clarification from then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. He was supported and assisted by General Leiutenant Mohammed Aziz. Musharraf is said to have executed the plan as Atal Bihari Vajpayee responded to Nawaz Sharif's invitation to Lahore and the duo signed the Lahore declaration. Conventional modes of warfare COMBAT MODE Well equipped with weapons of war, both sides were ready to launch attacks against each other. The 18,000-foot high-altitude battle in the rocky terrain was conducted under extremely low temperatures, conventionally, despite the fact that both sides possessed nuclear weapons. India has placed five infantry divisions, five independent brigades and 44 paramilitary battalions in Kashmir and has deployed 60 front-line aircraft. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with army officers and air force greet India Gate on Vijay Diwas INDIAN AIR FORCE On May 24, 1999, it was decided that the operation would be joined by the army Indian air (IAF). However, it was pointed out that the IAF would not cross the LOC at any cost. The IAF has launched bomb attacks against the enemy within its limits. Tiger Hill, one of the highest peaks in the Drass-Kargil region of the state, became the focal point during the war. After a fierce war of more than sixty days, and with the support of the international community, India has taken Tiger Hill back and repelled Pakistani forces on its territory. Schoolchildren fly a national flag on an Indian Army tank to commemorate the day INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO THE CONFLICT Pakistan's infiltration of India and the military clash have been sharply criticized by many countries and have attracted state intervention In the crisis. According to an article in the Daily Times, one of Pakistan's leading newspapers, India won the trust of the United States while Pakistan ""lost credibility in the eyes of India and Pakistan."" The international community has begun to put pressure on the Pakistani forces and threatened them with withdrawing or facing isolation. Russia and Israel have also come out in support of India's position. A paratrooper from the Indian Army with a backdrop of Tiger Hill and Tololing Ridge at Drass as he lands",NAG

"Top 10 tricks played by the media to control the masses:

1. Project ""everything is fine"" in default mode - even if it is not - which brings the public to complacency. ('news' buffer routine, sports, celebrity gossip, science, etc.). This technique is used by shepherds raising sheep for slaughter.

2. Emphasize individual identity (nationality, religion, state, etc.), to ensure subconscious separation (the politics of divide and rule).

3. Against ""the voice of the poor"" / ""power of protest"" etc., although these do not exist. It fools people to ""think"" that they are in control.

4. Organize events (""astro-turfing"", ""shills"", ""false witnesses"", ""crisis actors"", etc.), either to make a ""mass movement"" or to create paranoia or extreme fear .

5. Use sports, celebrities and gossip, etc., to distract from real problems (and shape public opinion).

6. Play the key support role for major sponsored events, hoaxes, etc. (for wars, laws, creating fear, distraction, etc.) Many of your favorite presenters and journalists are actually intelligence officers.

7. Describe the government as a victim of crime (cheating, aggression, etc.), so that the people do not protest later against the draconian laws against themselves.

8. Make extreme fear, by exaggerated claims of disease, enemy power, terrorism, etc. (to support wars, desensitize or divide people, for example)

9. ""Media blackout"" (not reporting leads to ignorance or stupidity) or malicious reporting (stereotyping or demonization) - the most common control technique.

10. Finally, and most secretly, the media belong to a handful of companies and suppress other sources of information. The media is the ""matrix"" - a network of illusions to deceive the masses and, with ""politics"", they are both secretly detained by banker families.

Next time your favorite news media 'break the news', ask yourself, ""Is this true, or is it their last operation shill / hoax / false flag""?",OAG

Dear Indian,
I'm sorry to write that your reporters are there to misinterpret the events and present them in a distorted way just to make sensational headlines. The news about future singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and call.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified lawyer (Mufti) at the request of a person who does not understand the religious guidelines while the booklet that is distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a paper copy an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed on many points and in many dimensions, but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

2. There are Israeli citizens who are Muslim. These Israeli Muslim citizens are banned from entering 16 Muslim countries. Does any of these people, as mentioned above, shout ""Islamophobia"" or ""Muslim ban"" about these countries? Do they protest in front of the embassies of these countries? I do not think so.

Maybe someone you meet who accuses Trump of ""Islamophobia"" or a ""Muslim ban"" should be made aware of these facts, mentioned above. Perhaps they should also be informed that Trump's executive order is a temporary, non-permanent order like the 16 other countries that have permanent bans.

Just for the continuing education of those led by George Hitler Soros, here is the list of countries that prevent Israeli citizens from entering:

The Indus Water Treaty is illegal
The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 was signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ""nowhere is it said that the said agreement / treaty was signed on behalf of the President of India"" ,
""According to documents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, no disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India ...""

""According to the disputed agreement, 80% of the water goes to Pakistan, which constitutes a serious infringement of the fundamental right of the citizens of India, associated with new financial and natural attacks on the national interest.""

If we Indians continue to give up today, our future generations will want and will never forgive us

India must be like China fast and furious and must have the ability to say on the face.
China Claim the South China Sea
China has made and develops 7 artificial islands made on the South China Sea so quickly
So why India can not stop the water of our own states and territories of the Union of India
We need to build more dam on the Indus River and have to have Iccha-Shakti to say one sentence to the World Bank F * ck Off
India treats Indus water treaty

If China can do for their mother earth
So why not India (if India can not do it)
Then theirs is a serious problem in our system of Indian government with our political parties and also with our useless politician.
Who knows just barking but can not take action.

Dear Indian,
I'm sorry to write that your reporters are there to misinterpret the events and present them in a distorted way just to make sensational headlines. The news about future singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and call.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified lawyer (Mufti) at the request of a person who does not understand the religious guidelines while the booklet that is distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a paper copy an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed on many points and in many dimensions, but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"""ARTICLE 370 INDIAN DISRUPTION OF SOVEREIGNTY AND INTEGRITY""

Article 370 of the Indian Constitution in an article granting a special autonomous status to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. (*** means Indian state Jammu and Kashmir).

The article is written in part xx1 of the constitution: temporary, traditional and special provision. (**** means that if the Indian constitution or the Indian parliament does not accept this provision then automatically Article 370 is not a valve and is not valid, and ready to delete from the Indian constitution)

Dr. Br. Ambedkar Garu the main draft of the Indian constitution, had refused to draft article 370. **** Dr. Br. Ambedkar Garu said that the state of Jammu and Kashmir is the integral part of India thus no special autonomous need)

Jammu and Kashmir accession to India dated October 26, 1947 since then, it was the Indian state. We must therefore remove Article 370 of the Indian Constitution for better governance.

I ask and tell the Prime Minister of India Respected Narendra Modi please take care of this article 370 and immediately delete in our Indian Constitution and Jammu & Kashmir State wants the business corridor, Industrial Hub and relationship with the Southern and Northern states. necessary step and cooperate .....

"Sikhs are a very peaceful community and do not try to punish anyone. Our gurus taught us to help others in need regardless of their caste or belief. In the days of the Mughals, Sikhs protected Hindu families and their wives against Muslims. All they want from the government is that an appropriate and impartial legal action be brought against the accused to give some hope to the families of the victims they have been deprived of for so many years. The government must also provide adequate cash and resettlement options for many families of victims who have lost their breadwinners in the genocide and are still living in urban ghettos.

This incident has really shaken the faith of the SIKH MINORITY community in the Indian government and many affected families have left the country. I distinctly remember those fateful days while I was studying at school in Delhi at that time. For the first time in my life, I felt like a member of a minority community in India. Even now, in Delhi and the surrounding areas of the Hindi-speaking cow belt, Sikhs are subjected to racist taunts, humiliated and mocked by them because of their unique identity. Even I was subjected to these humiliating jeers during my school days in Delhi.

Her only qualification was that she was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru was responsible for the partition of India. You can read the book written by Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad in case you have doubts.

It is very sad that even 27 years after the massacre of innocent Sikhs that took place from 1 to 3 November 1984 after Indira's death, no justice has been rendered to the victims of this heinous genocide or its perpetrators (especially their Goons) have been tried or made to book. According to the BBC, the first 20,000 SIKHS were massacred in broad daylight throughout India in four days and state police (such as the Delhi police) did nothing to stop this brutal ETHNIC CLEANING. They just stood there, like dumb spectators, watching the macabre spectacle that unfolded and, in some cases, even getting along with the culprits. It is not possible to commit such a murder in such a short time without the complicity of local congressional MPs (or perhaps even Congress leaders) who, as at DELHI and elsewhere, have incited crowds to speak out. Sikh vitriolist speeches gave his Goons electoral lists to help them locate Sikh houses, offer them free money, distribute weapons and offer financial rewards to their Goons to kill Sikhs, because most of these murderers were illiterate. THEIR SENIOR MINISTERS LIKE JAGDISH TYTLER & KAMAL NATH ARE INVOLVED IN THIS GENOCIDE. During this time, Sikhs were burned alive in front of their families, killed with iron bars, and their wives were taken and raped and their places of worship desecrated. For the Sikh community, it was like another HOLOCAUST. The state police became deaf to repeated calls by Sikh families to protect them as angry crowds continued their macabre action in one Sikh locality after another. In many Sikh localities, entire Sikh communities have been destroyed. There are pictures of laughing people beating Sikhs to death.

I was 13 years old in Delhi when this carnage took place. I have very vivid and painful memories of those days. I am also a Sikh, but fortunately we were safe because our residence was in the Delhi cantonment which was a secure area. If I had been in a zone of insecurity, I would have known the same fate. My father picked me up and my sister from our school bus on October 31, 1984, because we had to walk a little further than our house. I remember that the whole city was under curfew, between November 1st and 4th, 1984, and I did not go to school for a month. A strange silence of Death invaded the whole city. For the first time, I had the impression of being a member of the minority community living in a majority-led country. I remember seeing black vapors coming from Janakpuri on November 1st. We had to put security guards in front of our house for a month before things calmed down, but we also received threatening calls that a crowd would kill us.

The government has adopted delaying tactics (27 years after the carnage) by setting up committees after investigation to investigate this GENOCIDE, despite repeated testimony from the families of the Court Victims whose relatives were killed during the riots, but unfortunately, JUSTICE HAS NOT BEEN DELIVERED EVEN UNTIL NOW & the perpetrators and their hooligans are still wandering without scot. It is obvious that the government is trying to protect them and that big names are also involved.

I think that the Sikh community should file a complaint with the International Criminal Court in The Hague because the Indian government has not done justice to the affected families and until the current government is there, no justice will be done. DELAYED JUSTICE IS JUSTICE REFUSED. Until the Indian government provides swift and effective justice to the victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh pogroms, I will not be surprised if this carnage is repeated again and it will remain a dark chapter in the human rights record. from India.",OAG

Again nothing was received as confirmation or anything. Suddenly, an hour later, I received a call from Chennai saying that the plan change did not take place and I was advised to contact the call center. When he was informed at the call center, none of them was able to do anything, the call was transferred to the manager and he repeated what the old members said, which was ultimately useless.
If I change plan all the benefits like the offers of free internet packages that were there will be deleted. This is the only argument and they refuse to accept the plan change request in between, so it takes effect from the next billing cycle. but earlier, this was done to remove a package, but this had an effect on the next billing cycle.

"What you need to know about the President of Turkey, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 led to a 64% growth in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $ 23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new agreement. Turkey's debt to the IMF was declared fully paid and it announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, Turkey's five-year credit default swaps traded at a record low of 1.17%, lower than that of nine EU member states and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish central bank had reserves of $ 26.5 billion. This amount reached $ 92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's term. Inflation rose from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.

Under the Erdoƒüan government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, 13500 km of motorways were built.

"The big myth about taxpayers in India Data from a group of chartered accountants .......
Mr Jetly said in his budget speech that we are largely a tax compliant company and submitted that only 3.7 crores fill ITRs in this poor country with 125 crore population.

The response of the certification authorities:

Sir,
We have 82 crore voters

- 75% are farmers, 61.5 crores (You have exonerated them directly but, they can also buy cars, bunglows etc. as you mentioned ... your political counterparts also benefit)

Balanced..........
20.5 crores

Less: 24% of the GLP class (below the poverty line)

Population of 15 crores (non-agricultural and non-GLP).

Less: Seniors, women who do not work, young unemployed, less than taxpayers ... political class .. (say 75%) ... in a typical Indian family, only 1 winning member and 5/6 depend on him. ..

Balance (15-11,25) = 3,75 crores is the winning class ... who can deposit ITRs and ... they are already filling it ....

.... so almost no gap because Mr. Jetly insists unnecessarily without knowing his country

if Looser Jetly wants more people to get into the tax net ... then ... instead of foolishly resorting to rampant raids, investigations ... notices ... review ... demonetization etc etc terrorism ... it should challenge its negative bureaucrats and .......

1. Introduce a simple farm income tax on big landowners (Say 10 Acres plus) - you can add 26% of Farmers as taxpayers (Politicians also appreciate that)

2. Instead of introducing penalties of 5000/10000 on latecomers of computer feedback ...
Go out with a positive approach and introduce incentives for returning computer returners (learn from Pakistan, IT appraiser gets a discount on car purchase)

3. Introduce the Privilege Card for those who pay taxes above certain limits. Privilege card to give benefits to people assessed as the priority quota in railway tickets, the use of airport lounges, subsidized medical facilities, etc.

4. Introduce medical insurance / life insurance on the basis of the average ITR filled ... as coverage up to twice the gross income in ITR filled for mediclaim and ten times the risk coverage in case of 'life insurance

5. Introduce a pension after age 65 on the basis of the tax paid by the taxpayer during his working life.

Let honest taxpayers get some direct benefits ...

Today, 3.3% of the Indian population meets the ITRs against 8% in China ... adding big farmers to the income tax could increase the figure to more than 10% ... this can you help cool your tax terrorism state of mind and a tax-compliant nation ... üòä

"""Hi"" My name is Gurmehar Kaur I am from Jalandhar, India My father, Captain Mandeep Singh, was killed in the Kargil War in 1999. I was 2 years old when he died. I have very few memories of him, I have more memories of how it feels to have no father, I also remember how much I hated Pakistan and Pakistanis because they killed my father. I also hated Muslims because I thought all Muslims were Pakistani, when I was 6, I tried to stab a woman in a burkha, because for some strange reason I thought she was responsible for My mother stopped me and made me understand that Pakistan did not kill my father, the war killed him, it took me time to know, but today I I learned to give up my hate, it was not easy but it's not difficult, if I can do it, you too. if a soldier, just like my father. I am fighting for peace between India and Pakistan. Because if there was no war between us, my father would still be there. I'm doing this video because I want the governments of both countries to stop pretending and solve the problem. If France and Germany can become friends after the two world wars, if Japan and the United States can put their past and work for progress, then why not us? The majority of ordinary Indians and Pakistanis want peace, not war. I question the caliber of leadership of both nations. We can not dream of becoming a first world country with third world leadership. Please, pull your socks. Speak to each other and do the work. State-sponsored terrorism. Enough spies sponsored by the state. Enough of state-sponsored hate. Enough people died on both sides of the border. Enough is enough.

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian,
I'm sorry to write that your reporters are there to misinterpret the events and present them in a distorted way just to make sensational headlines. The news about future singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and call.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified lawyer (Mufti) at the request of a person who does not understand the religious guidelines while the booklet that is distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a paper copy an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed on many points and in many dimensions, but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"Cow in Hinduism:

Eat beef (Mata cow) allowed in Hinduism.
The Rigveda (10/8/13) states: ""On the occasion of the marriage of a girl, oxen and cows are slaughtered.
Rigveda (6/17/1) states that ""Indra used to eat the meat of the cow, the calf, the horse and the buffalo.""
Manusmriti (chapter 5 / verse 30) says: ""He is not guilty of eating meat of edible animals, for Brahma has created both eaters and edibles.""
Maharishi Yagyavalkya says in Shatpath Brahmin (3/1/2/21): ""I eat beef because it is very sweet and delicious.""
Apastamb Grihsutram (1/3/10) says, ""The cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of 'Shraddha' ancestors and on the occasion of a wedding.""
Vashistha Dharmasutra (11/34) writes: ""If a Brahman refuses to eat the meat offered to him on the occasion of 'Shraddha' or worship, he goes to hell.",NAG

In our opinion, we are on the brink of a global meltdown and there will be a cyclical recession in the 2016-2018 period.

Global events that will exacerbate the recession:

- The IMF's foreign exchange reserve basket adds the Chinese yuan to its Forex basket, reducing the contribution of the euro to this basket by 7% +
- The euro will depreciate considerably
- BREXIT - British voters will vote for Britain to leave the EU
- The American elections and its uncertainty.
- Crude oil glut
- China Debt conversion into shares
- Shemitah year of 2016

A major global sale should have taken place on October 2, 2016 but as it is a Sunday October 3, 2016, which is a Monday, we will see a global sale and the global markets will correct more than 8% +

A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified lawyer (Mufti) at the request of a person who does not understand the religious guidelines while the booklet that is distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a paper copy an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed on many points and in many dimensions, but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

The Indus Water Treaty is illegal
The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 was signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ""nowhere is it said that the said agreement / treaty was signed on behalf of the President of India"" ,
""According to documents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, no disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India ...""

""According to the disputed agreement, 80% of the water goes to Pakistan, which constitutes a serious infringement of the fundamental right of the citizens of India, associated with new financial and natural attacks on the national interest.""

If we Indians continue to give up today, our future generations will want and will never forgive us

India must be like China fast and furious and must have the ability to say on the face.
China Claim the South China Sea
China has made and develops 7 artificial islands made on the South China Sea so quickly
So why India can not stop the water of our own states and territories of the Union of India
We need to build more dam on the Indus River and have to have Iccha-Shakti to say one sentence to the World Bank F * ck Off
India treats Indus water treaty

If China can do for their mother earth
So why not India (if India can not do it)
Then theirs is a serious problem in our system of Indian government with our political parties and also with our useless politician.

"What you need to know about the President of Turkey, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 led to a 64% growth in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $ 23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new agreement. Turkey's debt to the IMF was declared fully paid and it announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, Turkey's five-year credit default swaps traded at a record low of 1.17%, lower than that of nine EU member states and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish central bank had reserves of $ 26.5 billion. This amount reached $ 92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's term. Inflation rose from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.

Under the Erdoƒüan government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, 13500 km of motorways were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high-speed rail lines were built and the country's high-speed rail service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railways have been built and 5449 km of renewed railways.

Erdogan has invested more in the health system than any other predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which offers free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan has increased spending on education from 7.5 billion lire in 2002 to 34 billion in 2011, the largest share of the national budget allocated to a ministry, and the number of universities in Turkey having almost doubled from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

In 1996 $ 1 = 222 lire and in 2016 1 $ = 2.94 lire, even after the recent turmoil. again you indian tricked by Saffron gangsters panty government GANG",NAG

Dear Indian,
I'm sorry to write that your reporters are there to misinterpret the events and present them in a distorted way just to make sensational headlines.

It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and call.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified lawyer (Mufti) at the request of a person who does not understand the religious guidelines while the booklet that is distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a paper copy an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed on many points and in many dimensions, but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

A local telephone contact was established at the level of commanders in the Rawlakot-Poonch area on Monday night between Pakistan and the Indian Army authorities.

Indian authorities were informed that there was unnecessary hype after the allegations. Pakistan remains fully committed to maintaining peace and tranquility along the LOC and expecting the same from the other side and hope
caution is exercised and no action can be taken that could result in the deterioration of the environment and affect peace along the line of credit.

"Sub: - Like the 29/11, attacks can not be stopped without solving the Kashmir problem that can not be solved without the end of the game.

----- In the whole history of mankind it will be difficult to find another example where a country like India [six times that Pakistan especially India with a better level of progress in science and technology as shown by 'Mangal-yan' the mission of Mars] cowardly and helpless tolerates repeated humiliation by armed aggression on her. India is facing such a shameful situation for the simple reason that, like Pakistan (and Bangladesh), India does not stupidly understand that the last word on the partition of India still needs to be written.

Another thing is stirring a person like me born before independence and that too in the Kota region of my home state of Rajasthan. We were raised in a culture where a 'Sainik' giving his life in a war was considered 'Moksha' by 'Veergati' [and we were told the stories of Rani Padmini and other women from Chittorgarh becoming 'Sati' because their husbands got 'Veergati' in battle and Hada Rani (from Kota-Bundi given in marriage to Chittorgarh) cut off his head and sent it as a souvenir to his husband 'madhosh' to motivate him to fight the battle against the enemy and Rana Pratap never submitting to Akabar preferred to live in the jungle fighting tirelessly to recover the lost forts and the homeland].

This culture has always remained, but nowadays I see soldiers and their officers die (not at war with Pakistan) but like ""keede-makode"" (insects) and at the top we call ""Shaheed"" (the martyrs), I get confused if the culture in which we were raised was right or the current culture? (where a Veteran Colonel said after 29/11 on a TV program that after just 3 or 4 months training Jihadi under the very noses of security forces at the border etc. come from Pakistan and kill the good and Indian soldiers and their officers at the headquarters of the military camp / corps)

But in any case, it is high time for the GOI to realize that the previous Congress party and now the BJP led by PM Modi and all the other political parties in India have been and are unable to solve the Kashmir problem in because of their community mentality. Therefore, before it is too late, the GOI should save a meager $ 4,400 for the launch of the ""United India Party"", which alone can solve Kashmir and other problems faced by India.

It is hoped that the Friends of India will compel the Government of India to see reason as explained:

http://www.alwihdainfo.com/At-least-after-29-11-friends-should-advice-India-to-spend--4400-to-solve-Kashmir-problem_a45603.html

[Especially considering that India should not waste this opportunity where some Kashmiri Muslims are showing courage and patriotism to take office (with flag and flag) of the pro-Indian political party in Srinagar and in other parts of the valley. the order of the government of J & K and India does not work and, on the contrary, Pakistan-backed separatists have been able to inflict close to five months of closure to the Kashmiri population]

4) as the integration of indirect taxes, integrate all the direct taxes and collect them through the bank's transaction tax as suggested by arthakranti.
5) Continue withdrawal restrictions even after December 31st. 2016. Reduce the use of cash futures and limit itself to Rs.5000 / - per month for individuals and Rs.20000 / - to 100000 / - to companies according to their turnover.

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian,
I'm sorry to write that your reporters are there to misinterpret the events and present them in a distorted way just to make sensational headlines. The news about future singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and call.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified lawyer (Mufti) at the request of a person who does not understand the religious guidelines while the booklet that is distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a paper copy an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed on many points and in many dimensions, but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"Narender Modi is not a messiah as we used to think, but he's just another corrupt politician who wore the ""Messenger of Good Days"" mask. Shame on him. It does nothing but make fun of our innocent compatriots. Now, let me prove my points.
When Modi was campaigning for his BJP party in the 2014 general election, he promised to solve the Naxalite / Maoist case. He promised that he would solve the Kashmir problem and repeal Article 370. He promised that he would solve the problem of OROP for the men of the army. He promised to refute Pakistan in the hardest possible way. He promised to give young people a safe job / career. He promised to protect every woman from monsters. He promised to eliminate corruption. He promised to make India even more beautiful ... He promised to bring LokPal ... He promised to bring back black money from the Swiss bank ...
But it's ironic that he did exactly what he promised a few years ago. He did not even fulfill a single promise he made us ... I think he deceived us all ...
Our Jawans are killed by bloody Naxals / Maoists or by incorrigible Pakistan. We are deprived of work by abolishing many government positions and minimizing vacancies. This government is absolutely anti-government ... Farmers commit suicide every day. Women are being tortured openly ... Nagaland and Kashmir are demanding freedom and shouting anti-India slogans in the JNU of our national capital ... China is doing CPEC through Gilgit Baltistan without even taking care of our concerns.
I'm asking you after all we got by electing Mr. Modi? Are we not deceived? Yet we are all happy and voting for Modi just because some BJP members are speaking out against Muslims and in support of Ram Mandir ... Are not we fools? The hatred of Muslims is the only eligibility that forces us to support BJP ??
Please, realize the hard truth that BJP or Modi is not the party or the person we voted for ... We need to change our perception ... Our Jawans at the border are mutilated and we are helpless ... I am ashamed of my PM ...

Dear Indian,
I'm sorry to write that your reporters are there to misinterpret the events and present them in a distorted way just to make sensational headlines. The news about future singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and call.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified lawyer (Mufti) at the request of a person who does not understand the religious guidelines while the booklet that is distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a paper copy an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed on many points and in many dimensions, but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).
We are waiting for an apology from you for such an error. Dear Indian,

"welcome Sir
Please kindly return my experiences as a freelancer. Entrepreneur:
My life with the family as an Er. The contractors were spoiled because of dubious actions by vengeful officials of the corrupted ISI, SBI, KFC, and so on.
From 1982 to 1997, they played with my life as an SSI unit owner.
In 1990, I tried justice with the ISI and the SBI through the Kerala State Consumer Dispute Resolution Commission, and in 1992 an appeal was filed with the National CDRC, with both Commissions having judicial and non-judicial. I did not have a lawyer to pursue my fate. All members of both Commissions realized the truth, but with the help of the LIMITATION Act. But my inexperience and my obligation to the system, I am silent and I continue efforts to revive and rehabilitate my SSI SSI unit with the full cooperation of the Department of Industries.
On 7.7.1995, I paid KFC the single settlement in the spirit of KFC's letter of 23.6.95. But my inability to satisfy corrupt officials, the unit taken over by the Revenue Recovery Act on 30.5.95 was kept with KFC custody.
I was at KFC headquarters, Trivandrum after my OTS payment, until a road accident in Palauan over Trivandrum on 6.3.97.
I was under treatment at Trivandrum Medical College, Kannur District Hospital, Mangalore Municipal Hospital, and so on. At least in 1997, I visited KFC HO with the help of Crutches and found that the water was flowing. visit the Kerala State CDRC and will soon be filing a lawsuit against KFC. After three months, the Council received a response from KFC with a copy to me. On the basis of KFC's response, the Commission began to dictate the judgment and dismiss my complaint against Sue in the civil court.
The next day, I filed a petition for review in addition to a few others. On the day of the hearing, when I got up with the help of Crutches and began to express my point of view, the President of the Commission threatened to order huge costs against me. I managed to escape the so-called Consumer Court with fear.
But I know that anyone with common sense will do me justice on behalf of the National and State CDRC in both cases.
After, from 1977 to 2009, I was under acute mental depression.
I started writing to central and regional governments and thus passed 5 GO pages, in 2010 direct KFC to fix problems at the Council level and write to the various ministries of the Government of India to inform me and compensate because of doubtful actions of the ISI and SBI.
But my efforts still continue, corrupt officials also continue to resist my efforts at my 67th age.
What we understand from the synopsis of the situation
Officials have a good salary and support from all government executives to rescue the corrupt with the support of so-called Provision in judicial and quasi-judicial tribunals, such as the CDRC, the Human Rights Commissions, etc.

My fate is covered by Malayalam Manorama, The Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc. and are on my face book account.
Should I wait for prompt justice from the authorities concerned in my last days and who will effectively inform the formation of new security measures at independent meetings and prevent such bad experiences from suffering on my part and my family.

After 15 days, the same problem has occurred again. When I took my car to the dealership (One-up engines (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow-226005), they sent it to the service station for rectification problems and delivered the car after two days.

The same problem was again noticed on 13-02-2017. After only 20 more days, that is 24-02-17, the same problem was noticed all over the body of the car.

When I visit the dealer's authorized service station, they refuse to solve the problem and misbehave with me.

Today is 23.03.207 My car is still being repaired at Oneup Moters Arambagh for the last 20 days.

I brought the car for use my old parents and not to send it to the service station repeatedly for repairs or repair problems. My father suffers from heart problems. As you know, it is very difficult for the elderly or to visit the service station several times.",NAG

Dear Indian,
I'm sorry to write that your reporters are there to misinterpret the events and present them in a distorted way just to make sensational headlines. The news about future singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and call.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified lawyer (Mufti) at the request of a person who does not understand the religious guidelines while the booklet that is distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a paper copy an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed on many points and in many dimensions, but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"What you need to know about the President of Turkey, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 led to a 64% growth in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $ 23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new agreement. Turkey's debt to the IMF was declared fully paid and it announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, Turkey's five-year credit default swaps traded at a record low of 1.17%, lower than that of nine EU member states and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish central bank had reserves of $ 26.5 billion. This amount reached $ 92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's term. Inflation rose from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.

Under the Erdoƒüan government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, 13500 km of motorways were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high-speed rail lines were built and the country's high-speed rail service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railways have been built and 5449 km of renewed railways.

Erdogan has invested more in the health system than any other predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which offers free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan has increased spending on education from 7.5 billion lire in 2002 to 34 billion in 2011, the largest share of the national budget allocated to a ministry, and the number of universities in Turkey having almost doubled from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

In our opinion, we are on the brink of a global meltdown and there will be a cyclical recession in the 2016-2018 period.

Global events that will exacerbate the recession:

- The IMF's foreign exchange reserve basket adds the Chinese yuan to its Forex basket, reducing the contribution of the euro to this basket by 7% +
- The euro will depreciate considerably
- BREXIT - British voters will vote for Britain to leave the EU
- The American elections and its uncertainty.
- Crude oil glut
- China Debt conversion into shares
- Shemitah year of 2016

A major global sale should have taken place on October 2, 2016 but as it is a Sunday October 3, 2016, which is a Monday, we will see a global sale and the global markets will correct more than 8% +

Secondly, I have heard many non-Muslims say that Muslims are supposed to kill non-Muslims wherever they find them, although this is a misunderstanding that I want to clarify here; A verse from the Quran was revealed during a war at the time of the Prophet Muhammad in which Muslims were ordered to kill enemies but did not harm children and women who might be there for a reason any. Places to Not Start a War Before They Start Harming You More This verse has only been revealed for this particular time. There is no verse in the Qur'an that limits a Muslim to be a friend of non-Muslims or to kill anyone who is not Muslim. These are all rumors and misunderstandings that make some people sick and start playing hatred.

"Pigeral: If you have problems with Muslim Azan, you must also have problems with Hindu Aarti. Both cause noise pollution.

Agniveer: There is a difference.

1. How many times did you wake up at 4:30 in the morning because of the noise of the Hindu Aarti in the temples? Zero.

How many times did you wake up at 4:30 in the morning because of the noise of Azan in mosques? 365 times a year (if you live within 5 km of a mosque).

Zero vs 365 rules everything.

Even if the Aarti speaker in your community starts at 4:30 in full volume, you can simply go to the priest and he will reduce it. Try to do it with a Moulvi in ‚Äã‚Äãa mosque and see if you come back in one piece.

Pigeral: Huh, and what about your Ganesh Yatra, Hanuman Yatra? Do not they make noise? Stop them.

Agnivore: How many times a year do Ganesh Chaturthi and Hanuman Jayanti come?

Pigeral: At least 10 days.

Agniveer: And how many times does Azan arrive in the loudspeaker in a year?

Pigeral:

Agniveer: Why silence? Let me help you. 365 * 5 = 1825. And besides, there are rallies, bicycle acrobatics, processions, and so on. on B'Day of the Prophet, Eid and Muharram etc.

So it's 10 vs 1825+. Are 10 and 1825 the same?

Pigeral: Bad is wrong. There is no harm greater or smaller.

Agniveer: Ok, your waist size 34/36/38 is also wrong. Come train before commenting on our concerns about Azan.

Pigeral: How can you compare my fitness problem with a 20% minority problem?

Agniveer: In the same way that you compared 10 with 1825+.

Pigeral:

Agniveer: Why silence?

Pigeral: Look, you can not interfere in the religion of others. India is a multicultural society. Every religion has equal rights.

Agniveer: Equal Rights? Do we have equal rights? A Muslim can marry 4 women at a time and divorce them at will. A Hindu is imprisoned for doing the same. Where are the equal rights? And where are the equal rights for Muslim women? You just need equal noise rights. And you do not care about the situation of the 10 Muslim women crore?

Look, equal rights come with equal responsibilities. You follow equal laws, you will have equal rights. You act like a special hero, your $$ will be kicked.

And finally, there is another solid difference. There is a strong correlation between Azan's density and terror. Discover the places on earth where

1. Azan is maximum (let's call it Place 1)
2. Aarti is maximum (let's call it Place 2)

Then find out how many terrorists and terrorist organizations in the world are in groups 1 and 2.

This is the ultimate decisive test on which noise is dangerous and harmless.

Pigeral:

Agniveer: Why silence?

Pigeral: Who are you male?

Agniveer: A proud Hindu. A fervent worshiper of idols. A proud Jihadi-hater. A proud Indian. Agniveer is the name.

Now they have found the solution when you call, they say that the complaint has been registered, they do not know when the problem will be solved. The only thing they are very fast is to have a message recorded as a reminder for late payment or to call thousands of times or cut off the service immediately

"India is trying to say that Pakistan has made a surgical strike and returned safe and sound.

I smell something fetid. India has a huge presence of the army at the border. How did the Pakistani army go on a surgical strike? The Indian army knew nothing about it. How Pakistani returned safely.

It all happened at a time when the Turkish President was calling for talks on Kashmir ...

For me, India killed its own military personnel to blame Pakistan and prove that the Turkish president was wrong. We have seen it in the past, especially when the Indian army was massacring a Sikh village in Kashmir and accusing Pakistan of it. All this was done to get the sympathy of the American President Bill Clinton who came to plead in favor of the negotiations on Kashmir ...!",NAG

"* Trump's first day at the Oval Office after being elected president. *

First briefing of the CIA, the Pentagon, the FBI:

Trump: We must destroy ISIS immediately. No delays.

CIA: We can not do that, sir. We created them with Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and others.

Trump: The democrats created them.

CIA: We created ISIS, sir. You need it, otherwise you would lose funds from the natural gas lobby.

Trump: Stop funding Pakistan. Let India take care of them.

CIA: We can not do that.

Trump: Why is it?

CIA: India will cut Baluchistan from Pak.

Trump: I do not care.

CIA: India will have peace in Kashmir. They will stop buying our weapons. They will become a superpower. We have to finance Pakistan to keep occupied India in Kashmir.

Trump: But you must destroy the Taliban.

CIA: Sir, we can not do that. We created the Taliban to keep Russia in check during the 1980s. Now they keep Pakistan occupied and away from their nuclear weapons.

Trump: We must destroy the sponsorship regimes of terrorism in the Middle East. Let's start with the Saudis.

Pentagon: Sir, we can not do that. We created these plans because we wanted their oil. We can not have democracy there, otherwise people will get this oil - and we can not let their people own it.

Trump: So, let's invade Iran.

Pentagon: We can not do that either, sir.

Trump: Why not?

CIA: We talk to them, sir.

Trump: What? Why?

CIA: We want our stealthy drones to come back. If we attack them, Russia will erase us as they did to our friend ISIS in Syria. In addition, we need Iran to keep Israel in check.

Trump: So, let's invade Iraq again.

CIA: Sir, our friends (ISIS) already occupy 1/3 of Iraq.

Trump: Why not all of Iraq?

CIA: We need the Shiite government of Iraq to control IS.

Trump: I forbid Muslims to enter the United States.

FBI: We can not do that.

Trump: Why not?

FBI: Then our own people will become fearless.

Trump: I deport all illegal immigrants south of the border.

Border patrol: You can not do that, sir.

Trump: Why not?

Border Patrol: If they are gone, who will build the wall?

Trump: I forbid H1B visas.

USCIS: You can not do that.

Trump: Why?

Chief of Staff: If you do, we will have to outsource White House operations to Bangalore. Who is in India.

Trump (abundant sweating now): What the hell should I do as president ???

"Why India should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty
The Indus Water Treaty is illegal
The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 was signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ""nowhere is it said that the said agreement / treaty was signed on behalf of the President of India"" ,
""According to documents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, no disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India ...""

""According to the disputed agreement, 80% of the water goes to Pakistan, which constitutes a serious infringement of the fundamental right of the citizens of India, associated with new financial and natural attacks on the national interest.""

If we Indians continue to give up today, our future generations will want and will never forgive us

India must be like China fast and furious and must have the ability to say on the face.
China Claim the South China Sea
China has made and develops 7 artificial islands made on the South China Sea so quickly
So why India can not stop the water of our own states and territories of the Union of India
We need to build more dam on the Indus River and have to have Iccha-Shakti to say one sentence to the World Bank F * ck Off
India treats Indus water treaty

If China can do for their mother earth
So why not India (if India can not do it)
Then theirs is a serious problem in our system of Indian government with our political parties and also with our useless politician.

"Kevin Gaskin. You are welcome to search for the Bill of Rights, the American Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, but you will not find anything about the ""separation of Church and State"" contained in any of them.

Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802 to respond to a letter from them, asking why he would not proclaim national days of fasting and thanksgiving, as Washington and Adams had done before him. . The letter contains the phrase ""wall of separation between Church and State"", which led to the erroneous ""handrail"" for the Establishment Clause (US Constitution, Bill of Rights, Amendment I, Article III) that we use today.

""Why do I have religious freedom ...?"" The answer lies in the congressional documents that relate to our Constitution as we know it today. The drafting process of the First Amendment made the intentions of the Founders abundantly clear; Before approving the final wording, the First Amendment had a dozen different iterations and lengthy discussions.

""We do not want in America what we had in Britain: we do not want a denomination to lead the Nation, we will not all be Catholics, nor Anglicans, nor any other denomination, we want the principles of God, but we do not want a denomination to lead the nation. ""

This intention was well understood, as evidence by the court decisions after the First Amendment. In 1799, the court declared: ""By our form of government, the Christian religion is the established religion; and all sects and denominations of Christians are placed on the same footing. ""

It must be realized that our founding fathers strove to attain ""freedom of religion"" because of the oppressive authority of the Roman Catholic Church. It was not only Great Britain but most of Europe that fell under the awesome authority of Roman Catholicism. Our founding fathers undertook to recognize the many denominations of Christianity. Moreover, they intended to recognize each denomination equally, rather than granting the power of control to any denomination. Here lies the erroneous interpretation of the imprudent ""shorthand"" known as the ""separation of Church and State"".

A more specific statement is likely to ""separate denominations from church and state."" Such an interpretation is fully supported by Congressional documents in reference to the statement, ""We do not want in America what we had in Great Britain: we do not want a denomination that directs the Nation. We will not be all Catholics, nor Anglicans, nor any other denomination. We want the principles of God, but we do not want a denomination to lead the Nation. ""

As for the statement, ""most of our founding fathers were agnostics,"" that's just not true. It is a general statement proclaimed by those who oppose religion in general. Yes, there were agnostics at that time, but they were not as prevalent as was claimed. Thomas Paine was an Anglo-American political activist, philosopher, political and revolutionary theorist. Although he is considered one of our founding fathers, he was shunned for his known agnostic beliefs.

John Adams is another one wrongly accused of being agnostic. Yet, here is a quote from President Adams in reference to Thomas Paine; ""The Christian religion is, first of all the religions that have prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, fairness and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he wants. "" I believe you will agree about Mr. Paine are more than enough to dispel all the claims of his agnostic beliefs.",NAG

""According to documents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, no disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India ...""

""According to the disputed agreement, 80% of the water goes to Pakistan, which constitutes a serious infringement of the fundamental right of the citizens of India, associated with new financial and natural attacks on the national interest.""

If we Indians continue to give up today, our future generations will want and will never forgive us

India must be like China fast and furious and must have the ability to say on the face.
China Claim the South China Sea
China has made and develops 7 artificial islands made on the South China Sea so quickly
So why India can not stop the water of our own states and territories of the Union of India
We need to build more dam on the Indus River and have to have Iccha-Shakti to say one sentence to the World Bank F * ck Off
India treats Indus water treaty

If China can do for their mother earth
So why not India (if India can not do it)
Then theirs is a serious problem in our system of Indian government with our political parties and also with our useless politician.

"Q1) Are GDP data faked?

- Yes they are. They are not precise. They are trafficked to promote a lie.

Q2) Can you prove that GDP data is faked?

- Until January 2015, the Indian economy had grown since the mid-1980s. And then the magic happened. The Central Bureau of Statistics (CSO) has changed the way it calculates GDP by saying that it is necessary to do so by taking into account global practices. As a result, India has moved ahead of China and has become the fastest growing economy. In 2013-14, our economy grew by 6.9%, rather than 4.7%, which CSO data showed earlier. Even the country's chief economic adviser, Arvind Subramanian, said: ""I am intrigued by the new GDP growth figures.The revised figures show that GDP growth went from 4.7% to 5.1% in 2012-2013 and 5% to 6.9% in 2013-2014, which means an acceleration in GDP growth of 1.9 percentage points in 2013-14, just by comparing the new figures over time. "" also said that ""these figures, especially the acceleration in 2013-14, are at odds with other features of the macroeconomy."" Almost all economic experts, working in or out of government (including Mr. Raghuram Rajan) , questioned the GDP figures as they found that the realities on the ground reflected a completely opposite picture According to R Nagraj, an independent member of the subcommittee who reviewed the new methodology for estimating output, adopted central organization Stastal differed significantly from the report finalized by the subcommittee in September 2014.

Q3) What about the latest GDP data released after demonetization?

- They are also messed up. While the performance of some sectors has been better than their performance in previous quarters, the huge improvement in private consumption (almost doubled) seems very doubtful in the context of the currency crisis during the demonetization. It seems that the CSO has not been able to map the demonetisation effect in its data. The government and RBI have also said (as do some of their sensible critics) that the effect of demonetization can be mapped in the longer term. In addition, the OSC downgraded the 2015-2016 third quarter estimates by 0.3 percentage points to 6.9% from 7.2% previously, resulting in a significant improvement in the third quarter figures. quarter of 2016-2017. For those who do not find this surprising, the OSC has revised the estimates of the UP for the first and second quarters of 2015-2016. This downward revision of the third quarter of 2015-2016 helped to limit the effect of demonetization in figures.

Q4) I am not able to understand anything. Why?

- You will not be able to have it. You are neither a statistician nor an economist. Whenever reports and claims like these surface, a little more on the Internet than Facebook and Twitter, and read basic things and what the experts have to say about them.

Q5) But Modi Ji says the experts do not know anything. Do not you think he's right?

- After Hindutva, the best tactic of Modi ji is misinformation. He convinced people by believing that experts do not know anything. He disinforms people who know nothing but to believe him. They do not have enough time or will to discover the truth. And when the experts question his claims and he, people never understand what the experts say because they are not educated enough to understand.",CAG

"What you need to know about the President of Turkey, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 led to a 64% growth in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $ 23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new agreement. Turkey's debt to the IMF was declared fully paid and it announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, Turkey's five-year credit default swaps traded at a record low of 1.17%, lower than that of nine EU member states and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish central bank had reserves of $ 26.5 billion. This amount reached $ 92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's term. Inflation rose from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.

Under the Erdoƒüan government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, 13500 km of motorways were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high-speed rail lines were built and the country's high-speed rail service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railways have been built and 5449 km of renewed railways.

Erdogan has invested more in the health system than any other predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which offers free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan has increased spending on education from 7.5 billion lire in 2002 to 34 billion in 2011, the largest share of the national budget allocated to a ministry, and the number of universities in Turkey having almost doubled from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

Maharishi Yagyavalkya says in Shatpath Brahmin (3/1/2/21): ""I eat beef because it is very sweet and delicious.""
Apastamb Grihsutram (1/3/10) says, ""The cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of 'Shraddha' ancestors and on the occasion of a wedding.""
Vashistha Dharmasutra (11/34) writes: ""If a Brahman refuses to eat the meat offered to him on the occasion of 'Shraddha' or worship, he goes to hell.",NAG

Dear Indian,
I'm sorry to write that your reporters are there to misinterpret the events and present them in a distorted way just to make sensational headlines. The news about future singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and call.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified lawyer (Mufti) at the request of a person who does not understand the religious guidelines while the booklet that is distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a paper copy an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed on many points and in many dimensions, but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

Mr Jetly said in his budget speech that we are largely a tax compliant company and submitted that only 3.7 crores fill ITRs in this poor country with 125 crore population.

Sir,
We have 82 crore voters

- 75% are farmers, 61.5 crores (You have exonerated them directly but, they can also buy cars, bunglows etc. as you mentioned ... your political counterparts also benefit)

Balanced..........
20.5 crores

Less: 24% of the GLP class (below the poverty line)

Population of 15 crores (non-agricultural and non-GLP).

Less: Seniors, women who do not work, young unemployed, less than taxpayers ... political class .. (say 75%) ... in a typical Indian family, only 1 winning member and 5/6 depend on him. ..

Balance (15-11,25) = 3,75 crores is the winning class ... who can deposit ITRs and ... they are already filling it ....

.... so almost no gap because Mr. Jetly insists unnecessarily without knowing his country

if Looser Jetly wants more people to get into the tax net ... then ... instead of foolishly resorting to rampant raids, investigations ... notices ... review ... demonetization etc etc terrorism ... it should challenge its negative bureaucrats and .......

1. Introduce a simple farm income tax on big landowners (Say 10 Acres plus) - you can add 26% of Farmers as taxpayers (Politicians also appreciate that)

2. Instead of introducing penalties of 5000/10000 on latecomers of computer feedback ...
Go out with a positive approach and introduce incentives for returning computer returners (learn from Pakistan, IT appraiser gets a discount on car purchase)

I'm sorry to write that your reporters are there to misinterpret the events and present them in a distorted way just to make sensational headlines.

It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and call.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified lawyer (Mufti) at the request of a person who does not understand the religious guidelines while the booklet that is distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a paper copy an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed on many points and in many dimensions, but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).
We are waiting for an apology from you for such an error.

"Hindus with the full support of their religious writings, especially 'MANUSMRITI' has inflicted horrific torture on their untouchable women and dalits for centuries ... To promote child rape, baby girls were married to men older Hindus, even before puberty ... Polygamy was practiced by most Hindu males, especially Brahmins, such as Tiwaris, Dubeys, Choubeys etc ... With religion at their side, some of them they married more than 100 Hindu women, even on the death bed (infamous Antarjali Yatra) ... After the death of old husbands, the newly married baby-girls were made 'SATI' by throwing it on the pyre of her husband ...
A Bengali film titled 'Antarjali Jatra', directed by the famous director Goutam Ghose, was published in 1987. This film recounts the perverse practices of Kulin Brahminism as polygamy and ... 'the SATI practice', where a woman recently widow would be immolated on the funeral pyre of her husband.

All sorts of restrictions were imposed on WIDOWS ... on ""food intake"", ""remarriage of adolescent widows"", ""right to property"", ""social status"", ""recreation"" and others, while 'no genre restrictions used to be imposed on WIDOWERS!
Nowadays, Hindus mock the ""burqa"" used by Muslims ... But ask any Hindu, why the hell they keep their mother-wives-grandmothers under the ""GHUNGHAT"" or force their wives to use vermilion (SINDOOR / BINDI), when married Hindu men do not use any ... They would become speechless!

Left alone the commoner, even the goddess Sita had to appear for a fire test to prove her ""purity"" she was abandoned by the Hindu-God Ramchandra when she was pregnant and forced to live in the Hermitage of Valmiki. Finally, she had to commit suicide ... In the same way, Lord Krishna never married 'Radha' and abandoned her and never saw him again, after leaving Mathura for Dwarka! Although he had 16,100 junior women, besides 8 main queens!

Do you have the courage to name a single Hindu whose grand-ma / grand-ma was not raped by his grandpa / grandpa when she was just a child and had him produce children like a rabbit !!

Finally, let me admit that I am a Hindu pious myself! And I'm proud of my religion because it allows me to apply my brain to judge between right and wrong ... to criticize all the evil customs of Hinduism without fear, run away, change my ""DHARMA"" to adapt in the modern age.
