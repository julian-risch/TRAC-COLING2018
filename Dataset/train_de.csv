Now j & k statesmen are upset and misguided by infiltrators. For 10 days I have received thousands of answers received from j & k statesmen and some from pakistani people i have written thesis regarding intolerance in j & k state.

Here are some people dependent on terrorist organizations and Pakistan MILITENTS and other anti-national elements. Now they are making people with stones on army and police and they have raised slogans in favor of anti-national attitudes and wearing ISIS clothing and with Pakistani flags.

J & K State students need to receive images in South India collages because there is no mutual understanding and interaction between J & K state and Southern states. In my opinion, this is the great salvation for intolerance.

Need marriage proposals between south and north with j & k statesmen.

J & K State suffers from Lobour Acts and implementations because it does not survive a route map for living with good odds, this is the main problem in j & k state why teen law violates law.

Requires Industrial Hub in the J & K state for better yields.

I urge Prime Minister MODI Ji that, please bring the new reforms for j & k state for a better future to our citizens .... Jai Hind

"Doucett black. Your atheism is out of place in this Christian nation where you live.

Before you waste your time digging out the whole ""fallacy of church and state separation,"" remember the words of James Madison, the father of our constitution:

""We have all set our political institutions to the ability of humanity to self-govern, to the ability of each one of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, and to receive ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.""

The man who drafted our Constitution left no doubt that we should govern ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God. The congress holds Christianity as the established religion of this United States of America:

The process of drafting the first amendment has made clear the intention of the founders; Because before they adopted the final text, the First Amendment went through almost a dozen different iterations and in-depth discussions.

""We do not want in America what we had in the UK: we do not want a nation to lead the nation, we will not all be Catholics or Anglicans or any other denomination, we want God's principles, but we do not want a nation the nation rules. ""

This intention was well understood, as the court rulings after the First Amendment prove. In 1799, the court stated, ""According to our form of government, the Christian religion is the established religion, and all the sects and denominations of Christians are equal.""

Although the US almanac is a respected publication, it is not the ultimate authority. Our founding fathers, who speak through the United States Constitution, have such authority. Their position on these issues is actually confirmed by the Supreme Land Law, as the US Supreme Court proves. Maybe it's you who is ""stupid"" and needs to educate yourself?",OAG

As long as there are no ways to compensate for this loss, no concessions can be made. Was demonetization successful in curbing black money, the government? would have had additional revenue to allow for concession in personal taxation. Given that the concession in this score is nominal if not negative, taking into account inflation, the face of the EU budget 2017 is that there is very little success in containing the black money through demonetisation. On the other side govt. needed money for various welfare systems and certain sources to raise that money. Since independence, the salary group has been the safest source of tax revenue, and hence the government. decided to drive it for another time. The people who were happy that the ill wealth of the dishonest people in their neighborhood has now been captured are probably still unaware of it. If you are still pleased to see the household analysis on TV and think that this budget is a big booster for the rural and infrastructure sectors, here is a statistic.

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).

For a moment I was stunned; Maybe like many of his passionate supporters. Why should BJP commit a harakiri, attack the minority, get some of the media and the opposition to start an attack with renewed strength and joy (I told you!) Will it damage its reputation and challenge its development agenda?
But I know that Modi & Amit Shah, their ability to think ahead, have a game plan with far-reaching consequences that will give them a rich dividend in the election campaigns across the board.
Assuming that they secure for the next two years a splendid model of government with high growth and peace, coupled with an impartial administration, they bury the spirit and the day of the ""communal"", neutralize and silence the critics forever! If the epitome of the ""monster"" of the right wing can make this paradigm shift, he will be able to get the minorities into their flock, which they have not been able to do so far.

"Distinguished Mr. Law MINISTER Sir,
Please make it comfortable to initiate the outstanding complaints.
My life with the family as He. Entrepreneur was corrupted for Dubious Actions by vengeful officials of corrupt ISI, SBI, KFC, etc.
From 1982 to 1997, they played with my life as an SSI owner.
In 1990, I tried justice by ISI and SBI through Kerala State's Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission and in 1992 filed a complaint with National CDRC, both commissions with judicial and non-judicial officers found some technical reasons to deny me justice. I had no lawyer to sue for my plight. All members of both commissions recognized the truth, but with the help of the LIMITATION Act. But my inexperience and commitment to the system, I became silent and continued efforts to revive and rehabilitate my Sick SSI unit with full cooperation of the Industries Department.
On 7.7.1995 I paid to KFC on One Time Settlement in full spirit of the letter from KFC on 23.6.95. But my inability to please the corrupt official, the unit taken over by the Revenue Recovery Act on May 30, 1995, was kept in custody by KFC.
I was in the headquarters of KFC, Trivandrum after my OTS payment, up to a traffic accident in Palauan via Trivandrum on 6.3.97.
I was treated by the Medical College Trivandrum, the Kannur District Hospital, the City Hospital Mangalore, etc., and at least in 1997 I visited KFC HO with the help of crutches and realized that instead of blood blood flows through the officials and the same day I visited the Kerala State CDRC and filed a complaint against KFC the next day. After three months, the Commission received a reply from KFC with a copy to me. On the basis of KFC's response, the Commission began to dictate the verdict and dismiss my complaint to Sue in the civil court.
The next day, I submitted a review petition alongside a few others. The Hearing Day, when I stood with the help of crutches and started expressing my opinion, threatened the President of the Commission with enormous costs to be ordered against me. I managed to escape the so-called consumer court with fear.
But I still know that someone of common sense will give me justice in both cases by the state and state CDRCs.
After 1977 to 2009 I had an acute mental depression.
I started writing to Central and State Governments, handing over 5 pages of GO, in 2010 directly to KFC, to resolve board-level issues and write to various ministries of the Indian government to call me over for Dubious Actions by ISI and SBI ask and compensate.
But my efforts continue, the corrupt officials resist my efforts even in my 67th year.
What we understand from the summary of the plight
The officials have a good salary and support from all government cadres to protect corrupt ones with the support of the so-called commission before judicial and quasi-judicial ones such as CDRCs, human rights commissions, etc.

My plight covered by Malayalam Manorama, the Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc .. and are on my face book account.
In the last few days, should I wait for a speedy judicial review by the competent authorities, which will effectively establish new safeguards for self-employed contacts and prevent those bad experiences that I and my family suffer?

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).
We expect an apology from you for such a mistake",CAG

"Margaux S Milk. The Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the United States of America and the Bey and the Subjects of Tripoli of Barbary, signed in Tripoli on November 4, 1796, Article 11 was established as a dispute between the English and Arabic translations of the treaty. Adams criticized the Roman Catholic Church's claim to universal authority, which could well form the basis for the wording of Article 11.

While it is true that Adams has signed the above contract, it should be noted that he also signed the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights; Both are meant to misunderstand Adams's words. The fact that Congress has unanimously signed the treaty is absurd, if you accept the whole translation theme.

John Adams was both a devout Christian and an independent thinker. In a letter to Benjamin Rush, Adams attributed to the religion the success of his ancestors since their migration to the New World in the 1630s. He also believed that regular worship was conducive to the moral sense of man. In 1796 Adams condemned the deistic critique of Thomas Paine's political opponent of Christianity in the age of reason: ""The Christian religion is above all the religion that reigned or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, justice and humanity, let the Black Paine say what he wants. ""

In view of Adam's Christianity, translations from English into Arabic are very unlikely to be transcribed correctly. It is far more plausible that he rejected the claims of ""universal authority"" proclaimed by the Roman Catholic Church as anything that removed the basis of the Christian religion.

Adams twice served as vice president under President George Washington. The words of our esteemed first president in his farewell address dispute any idea that this United States of America is not founded on the Christian religion; ""And let us dare with caution the assumption that morality can be sustained without religion, whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on the heads of the peculiar structure, reason and experience forbid us to expect the national Morality under exclusion of the religious principle. ""

The words of James Madison, the father of our Constitution, clearly contradict the notion that America is not a Christian nation; ""We have all set our political institutions to the ability of humanity to self-govern, to the ability of each one of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, and to receive ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.""

While Puerto Rico is a US territory, they still need to acquire statehood. Indigenous languages ‚Äã‚Äãdo not take precedence over the English language in any of our states. Your argument is a controversial point until the moment you earn this statehood. We are all very aware that the US is not Israel; It is pointless to repeat the obvious, especially if it is irrelevant to the present point. Maybe you should read ""more?""",NAG

"What you should know about Turkish President Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused 64% real GDP growth and 43% GDP per capita growth.

Erdoƒüan inherited a $ 23.5 billion debt to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new contract. Turkey's debt to the IMF was therefore declared fully paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, five-year sovereign credit default swaps hit a record low of 1.17%, below the levels of nine EU Member States and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish central bank had reserves of $ 26.5 billion. This amount reached USD 92.2 billion in 2011. During the tour of Erdoƒüan. Inflation fell in 2004 from 32% to 9.0%.

Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, a further 13500 km of motorway were built.

High-speed lines were built for the first time in Turkey's history and the country's high-speed train was put into operation in 2009. In 8 years 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway line renewed.

Erdogan has invested more in the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the Green Card program has been introduced, offering free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan increased spending on education from LR 7.5 billion in 2002 to LR 34 billion in 2011. The highest share of state budget in a ministry and the number of universities in Turkey almost doubled from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

In 1996 1 $ = 222 lira and in 2016 1 $ = 2.94 lira, even after the recent turmoil.",NAG

If you mean ""appeasement"" appeasement of mullis.
Who is the most backward part in this country? Muslims.
Why do you ask? Communal biases, ghettoization, repeated persecution
Just for your information, Muslims are even more backward than Dalits, SCs, STs even non-Hindu SC / ST (Tribal's). In fact, the backward, poorest and ghettoized community in India is Muslim.
If questions from these communities are bought in Parliament, nobody turns. Ex Jat, Patel, Tamil, SC, Dalit, Zoroastrian, Sikh, but if you talk about the conditions of Indian citizens who happen to be Muslim, then his appeasement, the 14.2% of India's population.",CAG

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).
We expect an apology from you for such a mistake",CAG

"I would like to mention here that about a month ago I bought a car Vitara Breeza ZDI from One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow - 226005, with the vehicle registration number UP 32 HQ 5615.

In the next few days after the delivery of the car, I noticed some cloudy parts and blisters on the driver and passenger door of the car. Then I talked to the dealership about the problem that they noticed the problem and sent my car to their authorized Maruti Suzuki gas station on 02-01-2017 to fix the problem.

After 15 days the same problem recurred. When I drove my car to the dealer (One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow - 226005), they sent it to the gas station for repair and handed the car over to me after two days.

The same problem was found again on 13-02-2017. After only 20 days again, d. H. 24.02.2017, the same problem was found on the entire body of the vehicle.

When I visited the car dealership's authorized gas station again, they refused to solve the problem and behaved badly with me.

Today, d. H. on Mar 23, 2017 My car is still under repair with Oneup Mots Arambagh from the last 20 days.

I brought the car for my old parents and did not send it to the gas station for repair or repair. My father suffers from heart problems. As you know, it is very difficult for seniors or repeatedly to visit the gas station.",NAG

"Why should India # ScrapIndusWatersTreaty
Indus Water Contract is illegal
The fall of the Indus Water Treaty of 1960 was signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ""nowhere is it stated that the said agreement / treaty was signed on behalf of the President of India"",
""According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement was signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India ...""

""According to the challenged agreement, 80% of water goes to Pakistan, which is a serious violation of the fundamental right of the citizens of India, coupled with further financial and natural violations of national interest.""

If we Indians stop today, our future generations will blame us and never forgive us

India, like China, has to be fast and furious and have the ability to speak up.
China claim South China Sea
China made and developed 7 artificial artificial islands on the South China Sea so fast
Why then can not India stop the water from our own states and the Union territories of India?
We have to build more dam on the Indus River and have to have Iccha-Shakti saying only one sentence to the World Bank F * ck Off
India shuts up Indus Waters contract

If China can do for her motherland
Then why not India (if India can not)
Then her serious problem is in our Indian government system with our political parties and also with our useless politician.
Who can only bark, but can not act.

-> Step 1 - Create a political party and register under the representation of the People's Act of 1951. [No difficult task. There are more than 1000 registered parties that did not even attend the 2014 Lok Sabha election, and EC can not deregister a party.]
-> Step 2 - Donate all your black money to your party in parts, each part should be less than 20,000. You can make endless donations and say they are human.
[Under RP Act 1951, political parties are not required to report to the Electoral Commission of India (ECI) the names of persons or organizations from whom they have received donations of less than Rs. 20,000.]
-> Step 3 - Go to the bank and deposit the entire amount in the party's account.
[No need to pay income tax. Political parties are 100% exempt from income tax]
-> Step 4 - Drag the amount as and when you need in 50/100/500/2000 rupee notes - It's all white.
[Since political parties are not on RTI, you can not ask them how they spent their money]
ENJOY YOUR PROSPERITY ... !!!!

"Chronological of events of the last days (Is that a secularism?) ...

- The rape of a six-year-old girl in a school in East Bangalore raises the question of why the rapist was free under appeasement. (Congress Government, original party of secularism)

In the case of Meerut, it is a clear case in which several Madarassa are involved in heinous crimes, but no action, not even a discussion ... (UP Govt, Secular Party and Baby of the Congress)

- Kerala Vande Matram Kand.

- Now last Faizabad brutal rape and murder case It was much more brutal than NIRBHAYA case and five people had been involved in heinous crimes, but only one was arrested why? (UP Govt, secular party and baby of Congress). It's amazing that TOI prints a very small message on 13 pages from August 19, 2014.

- Yesterday, Loni, Ghaziabad case where 10 girls were allegedly raped by other community members at the age of 57 years and the police say that the case seems to be a nuisance (UP Govt, Secular Party and Baby of the Congress)

"Amazing, right? That liberals today use fascism because they paraphrase it. If they knew what fascism really was, a larger and larger government that oversaw and controlled private businesses, and taxed them to death, might not use so quickly because that description was so incredibly close to the Democratic government.
What else is a fascist move? Go to churches and places of worship? Set limits on what people can say, even in the privacy of their own homes? Widespread domestic espionage? Everything that was done by the Obama administration, and yet none of them would think to use the word fascist to describe those eight years.

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).

"Tiger: If you have problems with Muslim Azan, you also need to have problems with Hindu Aarti. Both cause noise pollution.

Agniverer: There are differences.

1. How many times have you been awakening in temples at 4:30 am due to the noise of Hindu Aarti? Zero.

How many times have you woken up in mosques at 4:30 am due to the noise of Azan? 365 times a year (if you live within 5 km of a mosque).

Zero vs 365 does it all.

Even if the Aarti loudspeaker near you starts at 4:30 am at full volume, you can just go to the priest and he will reduce it. Just try a Moulvi in ‚Äã‚Äãa mosque and see if you come back in one piece.

Tiger: Huh, and what about your Ganesh Yatra, Hanuman Yatra? Do not they make noise? Stop her.

Agniverer: How often do Ganesh Chaturthi and Hanuman Jayanti come in one year?

Tiger: At least 10 days.

Agniverer: And how often does Azan happen on speakers in a year?

Tiger:

Agniverer: Why quiet? Let me help you. 365 * 5 = 1825. And then there are rallies, bike stunts, processions, etc. on the Prophet's B'day, Eid, and Muharram.

So it's 10 against 1825+. Are 10 and 1825 the same?

Tiger: Wrong is wrong. There is no greater or less wrong.

Agniverer: Okay, then your 34/36/38 waist size is also wrong. Come to us before commenting on our concerns about Azan.

Tiger: How can you compare my personal fitness problem with a problem of 20% minorities?

Agniverer: Just as you compared 10 to 1825+.

Tiger:

Agniverer: Why quiet?

Tiger: Look, you can not interfere with the religion of others. India is a multicultural society. Every religion has equal rights.

Agniverer: Equal rights? Are we equal? A Muslim can marry 4 women at the same time and divorce at will. A Hindu is imprisoned for it. Where are the same rights? And where are the same rights for Muslim women? You only need equal rights for noise. And you do not care about the plight of 10 crore Muslim women?

Look, same rights have equal responsibilities. You follow the same laws, you get the same rights. You act as a special hero, your a $$ is kicked.

And finally, there is a big difference. There is a strong correlation between the density of Azan and terror. Find the places on earth where

1. Azan is maximum (let's call it # 1)
2. Aarti is maximum (let's call it 2nd place)

Then find out how many top terrorists / terrorist organizations in the world are producing Group 1 and Group 2. This is the ultimate litmus test where noise is dangerous and harmless.

Tiger:

Agniverer: Why quiet?

Tiger: Who are you man?

Agniverer: A proud Hindu. A proud idol worshiper. A proud jihadi hater. A proud Indian. Agniverer is the name.

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).
We expect an apology from you for such a mistake.",CAG

"The Sikh genocide of 1984

THE VERDICT DELIVERED IN THE NARODA PATIYA CASE IN THE ANTI MUSLIM GUJARAT RIOTS OF THE YEAR 2002 IS A WELCOME BUT IMPERFECTLY FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE GENERALISM OF I984 SIKH, WHICH WAS CLOSED IN RETALIATION AFTER THE INDIVIDUAL PRIMARY MINISTRY INDIRA GANDHI WAS CLOSED BY HER 2 SIKH BODYGUARDS OPERATION BLUESTAR, JUSTICE IS STILL DELIVERED. Although you've rated Indira Gandhi among the biggest Indians, I do not feel like she's done anything great to be on that list. We Sikhs do not keep it high. HOW CAN YOU CALL IN YOUR BIG INDIAN IF YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE UNKNOWN KILLINGS OF THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT SIKHERS WHO ARE A MINORITY COMMUNITY? She created only Bhindranwale to counter the Akalis in Punjab and is responsible for the rise of religious extremism in the state, because in addition there was no religious excuse in Punjab. Even after her death, 20,000 Sikhs throughout India (4,000 in Delhi alone) were murdered from October 31 to November 4, 1984, in a cold-blooded genocide led by the SECULAR CONRESS PARTY OF INDIA. Sikhs were burned alive in front of their families, women were raped and their property was set on fire. The mobs laughed as they killed the Sikhs. The thugs were led by local congressional MPS with Govt voter lists in their hands to help them find Sikh homes and properties and warned non-Sikhs to kill as many Sikhs as possible. Members of the local congress even gave the rioters money and told them that the person who will kill the maximum number of Sikhs will get the largest amount in addition to other incentives. From October 31 to November 3, blood-thirsty cries of ""KHOON KA BADLA KHOON SE LENGE - WE'RE BLOODED WITH BLOOD RAW"" were aired on Delhi Doordarshan, and even the well-known actor of Bollywood, Amitabh Bacchan, got people to join the Sikhs to kill. The congress was in the center during the riots and PVNarasimha Rao was the Home Secretary, but he did not do anything until November 2nd, even though he knew about the slaughter and the Delhi police were just silent spectators instead of protecting the Sikhs and let that go bloody carnage continues as directed by their political masters. Most of the senior police officers were intentionally placed on leave from 1 to 3 November, following the instructions of their political masters. The army was deliberately not called and only told them to come on the evening of November 2, but there was no one to guide them through the streets of Delhi. Then, on the 3rd of November, after her bloodstain was satisfied, as from the remote control, everything stopped. It was nothing but a cold-blooded genocide directed by high-ranking congressional politicians against the Sikhs. Had you acted on the first day of the riots, this genocide would never have happened. IT IS A GREAT SHADE FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THAT THE SIKH GENOCIDE PERIPHERATORS WERE NOT ESTABLISHED IN 1984 AND THERE WAS NO REPEATED RIGHT ORDERED AGAINST AN ONE PERSON OTHER THAN THE MULTIPLE CONVENTIONS IN THE GOSTHRA RIOTS 2002, WHICH HAPPENS MUCH LATER OFFER FROM THE FAMILIES OF THE OPFERS.

A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices.

"(Representative image) Thiruvananthapuram: According to an intelligence report submitted to the state police president seven months ago and retrieved by TOI, between 2011 and 2015, two ""recognized"" religious conversion centers in Kozhikode and Malappuram converted 5,793 people to Islam. Conversions that take place in unrecognized centers in the state could be much higher, fear government officials who for obvious reasons did not want to be named. The report states that nearly half of those who convert to Islam are women and that the majority of these women (76%) are under the age of 35. Of the converts, 4,719 were Hindus and the remaining 1,074 were mostly Christians. The conversions took place in Tharbiyathul Islam Sabha in Kozhikode and Monunsthil Islam Sabha in Ponnani, two traditional religious institutions in the state, which were authorized to convert people from other religions to Islam. The police report, which was created in connection with the conversion of Nimisha aka Fathima, who is currently missing along with 20 others from the state and is believed to have joined the Islamic State, says a detailed investigation is needed to Check if these conversions were under pressure were enticements involved or were voluntary. ""Inquiries are needed to know if this will affect communal harmony, state security and nation security."" A detailed SSB (State Special Branch) investigation into Kasaragod, Kannur, Alappuzha, Thiruvananthapuram and Palakkad is recommended, the details ""Report previously sent by Kasaragod SP, A Srinivas, who investigated the Nimisha case in November 2015.

"Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,,

Thanks for the support.

Please see our latest event with the FIA ‚Äã‚Äãin Washington DC.

With confidence,
Dr. A Monica Dorhoi
Chairman of the IWF Staff Meditations Club of the World Bank
in Washington DC

[Updated] The meditation club will meet on Monday, 11 January 2016, with the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile Foundation (FIA)

Just updated ... Thank you for inviting the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile Foundation (FIA) on Monday 11 January 2016

Dr. Dorhoi attended the reception of the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) at the Marriott Marquis in Washington DC on Monday, January 11, 2016. Previously, she spent 7 years funding road rehabilitation worldwide. Dr. Dorhoi also works on the financing and management of risks in Formula 1 within the framework of different financing requirements.

Many thanks to the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile Foundation (FIA) for preparing and publishing progress on the implementation of the United Nations Road Safety in 2015 objectives. The report was prepared by the World Health Organization.

The event also featured the book ""Goals for Change, Partners for Action"" of the 2015 Annual Report of the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile Foundation (FIA).

The report welcomes the UN Decade of Road Safety and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. More specifically, the Energy Goals for Development have been translated into a Global Fuel Economy Initiative, in which the Foundation supports governments in developing global and regional programs to find evidence of effectiveness at national and city level and donors to support national policies and policies initiatives.

In the United States, about 40% of traffic-related deaths have been reduced in recent years. The United Nations 2020 Millennium Development Goals on Road Safety are designed to reduce road fatalities by 50% compared to today's levels.

For Dr. Dorhoi's association with the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile Foundation (FIA) is blessed by her long-standing devotion to the cause of Ayrton Senna. The F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) is the organizer of the Formula 1 race championships, and Mrs Dorhoi, an American who has lived in Washington DC for the past 15 years, has been a big fan for over two decades. Dorhoi is one of the biggest fans of the much loved Formula One racing driver Ayrton Senna, who died in 1994 in San Marino. ""The tragedy really shaped me undeniably.""

Dr. Dorhoi is also grateful to Alan Prost of France and Williams Renault for the sportiness after the loss of driver Ayrton Senna.

[Further information: Updated press release was released at the venue.]

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).

""According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement was signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India ...""

""According to the challenged agreement, 80% of water goes to Pakistan, which is a serious violation of the fundamental right of the citizens of India, coupled with further financial and natural violations of national interest.""

India, like China, has to be fast and furious and have the ability to speak up.
China claim South China Sea
China made and developed 7 artificial artificial islands on the South China Sea so fast
Why then can not India stop the water from our own states and the Union territories of India?
We have to build more dam on the Indus River and have to have Iccha-Shakti saying only one sentence to the World Bank F * ck Off
India shuts up Indus Waters contract

I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines.

A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).

"ARUNACHAL PRADESH, INDIA - HIDDEN GATEWAY for CHINA'S NEEDS OF SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL RIPARIAN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM
==========================================

Arunachal Pradesh in India, the Land of the Rising Sun, undisputed beauty queen of nature and powerhouse of hydropower has always been a point of contention between India and China.

But why is China so popular to have Arunachal Pradesh as part of Tibet? Is it just Rilio-geo or geopolitical or militaristic or expansionist thinking in China? Why is China playing a zero-sum game, knowing that India will not part with Arunachal Pradesh at all costs?

It is undeniably clear to everyone that the core growth engine of the Chinese economy is a SUSTAINABLE RIPARIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEM, which has two components as LOCAL & GLOBAL.

It is the GLOBAL FUNCTION that powers ARUNACHAL PRADESH from India via NAGALAND as GATEWAY for China to the offshore transportation system on RIVER KALADIN from MYANMAR to BENGAL's BAY (via Sittwe Sea Port of Myanmar, which eventually makes KOLKATA-DHAKA-SITTWE) power commercial corridor by ""BANGLADESH-BHUTAN-INDIA-NEPAL MULTILATERAL HIGHWAY"" coupled with INDIA-MYANMAR-THAILAND TRILATERAL HIGHWAY thereby effectively replacing NORTH-EAST INDIA as HUB of the ACT-EAST policy of INDIA by BENGAL, INDIA) as current global trans-shipment system takes too many To cover times and distances.

Grandma, grandpa, mom and dad; So, each of them can do other things while spending part of the day with the child. Sometimes both parents share responsibility. Sometimes one parent focuses on work and the other is a full-time coach. Sometimes you hire reliable help. No configuration is wrong. Economic factors also play a role in the decision.

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).

"The situation of West Bengal has become terribly communal. I'm from West Bengal. We experienced a series of communal riots in which the majority of Hindus were harassed, beaten, and Muslim illegal immigrants from Bangladesh ransacked Hindus, shops, and religious temples. Hazinagar, Malda, Chandanagar, Dulagarh and a number of places where Hindus are still targeted. We live in fear because the Mamta government offers full support to these rogues. Local Bengali media must not show the current situation of West Bengal. We urge the central government to seriously deal with the matter, otherwise West Bengal will soon become mini-Bangladesh or mini-Pakistan. The Mumtaz Beghum government arrests every media channel that seeks to spread these Muslim riots, slaughtering Hindus.

Currently, there is no problem in proper Kolkata, but conditions in rural and small towns far away from Kolkata are changing fast ..

"Nice to write. However, before we come to the conclusion that there are no gains in sight, we should keep our eyes open and look for the profits that are overlooked in this article. 1) This could still be a paradigm shift. Do not forget that the currency is growing fast in our economy. In the words of former RBi governor Subbu Rao, ""it has risen 15 percent since the 2015/16 fiscal year, significantly faster than the 10.7 percent trend rate over the past three years, and even the increase in e-transactions does not adequately explain this An increase in demand for currency, suggesting a different dynamic, was apparently in response to this uncharacteristic expansion of currency in circulation, clearly in line with the pace of economic expansion, a trend that would definitely be stopped if the government is serious and continues its efforts sincerely And the economy could see much less cash in circulation 2) Temporary pressure in cash is forcing many to go into electronic payments Convenience and efficiency will cause to withdraw them permanently from the cash wherever possible 3) With much less cash in the underground The black money would be blocked in the country and gold would not easily be converted into cash. This could also reduce the illegal activities. 4) Lower land and housing prices would ultimately benefit the economy. 5) All the 12lakh crore reported to have entered the banking system have left a trail. Tax authorities can track them, and this could increase the cost of doing business through parallel economics.",NAG

What you should know about Turkish President Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused 64% real GDP growth and 43% GDP per capita growth.

Erdoƒüan inherited a $ 23.5 billion debt to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new contract. Turkey's debt to the IMF was therefore declared fully paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, five-year sovereign credit default swaps hit a record low of 1.17%, below the levels of nine EU Member States and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish central bank had reserves of $ 26.5 billion. This amount reached USD 92.2 billion in 2011. During the tour of Erdoƒüan. Inflation fell in 2004 from 32% to 9.0%.

Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, a further 13500 km of motorway were built.

High-speed lines were built for the first time in Turkey's history and the country's high-speed train was put into operation in 2009. In 8 years 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway line renewed.

Erdogan has invested more in the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the Green Card program has been introduced, offering free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan increased spending on education from LR 7.5 billion in 2002 to LR 34 billion in 2011. The highest share of state budget in a ministry and the number of universities in Turkey almost doubled from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

"My life with the family as He. Entrepreneur was corrupted for Dubious Actions by vengeful officials of corrupt ISI, SBI, KFC, etc.
From 1982 to 1997, they played with my life as an SSI owner.
In 1990, I tried justice by ISI and SBI through Kerala State's Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission and in 1992 filed a complaint with National CDRC, both commissions with judicial and non-judicial officers found some technical reasons to deny me justice. I had no lawyer to sue for my plight. All members of both commissions recognized the truth, but with the help of the LIMITATION Act. But my inexperience and commitment to the system, I became silent and continued efforts to revive and rehabilitate my Sick SSI unit with full cooperation of the Industries Department.
On 7.7.1995 I paid to KFC on One Time Settlement in full spirit of the letter from KFC on 23.6.95. But my inability to please the corrupt official, the unit taken over by the Revenue Recovery Act on May 30, 1995, was kept in custody by KFC.
I was in the headquarters of KFC, Trivandrum after my OTS payment, up to a traffic accident in Palauan via Trivandrum on 6.3.97.
I was treated by the Medical College Trivandrum, the Kannur District Hospital, the City Hospital Mangalore, etc., and at least in 1997 I visited KFC HO with the help of crutches and realized that instead of blood blood flows through the officials and the same day I visited the Kerala State CDRC and filed a complaint against KFC the next day. After three months, the Commission received a reply from KFC with a copy to me. On the basis of KFC's response, the Commission began to dictate the verdict and dismiss my complaint to Sue in the civil court.
The next day, I submitted a review petition alongside a few others. The Hearing Day, when I stood with the help of crutches and started expressing my opinion, threatened the President of the Commission with enormous costs to be ordered against me. I managed to escape the so-called consumer court with fear.
But I still know that someone of common sense will give me justice in both cases by the state and state CDRCs.
After 1977 to 2009 I had an acute mental depression.
I started writing to Central and State Governments, handing over 5 pages of GO, in 2010 directly to KFC, to resolve board-level issues and write to various ministries of the Indian government to call me over for Dubious Actions by ISI and SBI ask and compensate.
But my efforts continue, the corrupt officials resist my efforts even in my 67th year.
What we understand from the summary of the plight
The officials have a good salary and support from all government cadres to protect corrupt ones with the support of the so-called commission before judicial and quasi-judicial ones such as CDRCs, human rights commissions, etc.

My plight covered by Malayalam Manorama, the Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc .. and are on my face book account.
In the last few days, should I wait for a speedy judicial review by the competent authorities, which will effectively establish new safeguards for self-employed contacts and prevent those bad experiences that I and my family suffer?

"y. Indian Army Band plays in drass WHEN WAS WAR FOCHT? The Kargil War, which began in May 1999, was announced after the infiltration of Pakistani troops and Kashmir militants into the Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir and along the line of control (LOC). The invasion of the area separating the Ladakh Indian region from the northern areas of the state was a complete surprise to the Indian army, and Operation Vijay was immediately launched to rinse our enemies from the Kargil sector. Pakistani soldiers MASTERMIND BEHIND THE ATTACK Pervez Musharraf, the then army chief of Pakistan, is considered the brain cell behind the attack. Musharraf has carefully crafted the intrusion plan without details of then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. He was supported and supported by General Mohammed Aziz. It is said that Musharraf carried out the plan while Atal Bihari Vajpayee had responded to Nawaz Sharif's invitation to Lahore and where the duo signed the Lahore Declaration. Conventional warfare was used. MOVEMENT MODE Well equipped with war weapons, both sides were ready to attack each other. The 18,000-foot battle in the rocky terrain was carried out under extremely low temperatures in a conventional manner, although both sides had nuclear weapons. India positioned five infantry divisions, five independent brigades and 44 battalions of paramilitary troops to Kashmir and deployed 60 frontline aircraft. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with Army and Air Force Officers Greetings at the India Gate in Vijay Dias THE INDIAN AIRFORCE On May 24, 1999, it was decided that the operation would be accompanied by the Indian Air Force (IAF). However, it was stressed that the IAF would not exceed the LOC at any cost. The IAF launched bombing raids on the enemy within its border. Tiger Hill, one of the highest peaks in the state's Drass-Kargil area, became the focal point during the war. After a fierce war of more than sixty days and with the support of the international community, India retook Tiger Hill and pushed the Pakistani troops back into its territory. INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO CONFLICT Pakistan's infiltration into India and the military clash have been deeply criticized by many countries, driving the US intervention into the crisis. According to a report in the Daily Times, a leading newspaper in Pakistan, India gained US confidence, while Pakistan lost credibility in the eyes of India and Pakistan. The international community began to build pressure on the Pakistani armed forces, threatening them to withdraw or be isolated. Russia and Israel also appeared to support the attitude of India.

"Top 10 tricks with which the media control the masses:

1. Project ""Everything is alright"" in standard mode - even if this is not the case - and so lull people into complacency. (Buffer routine ""news"", sports, celebrity gossip, science, etc.). This technique is used by shepherds who keep sheep for slaughter.

2. emphasis on individual identity (nationality, religion, state, etc.) to ensure a subconscious separation (the policy of sharing and governing).

3. Lead the ""voice of the poor"" / ""power of protest"" etc., although these do not exist. This deceives people to ""think"" that they are in control.

4. Stage events ('astro turfing', 'shills', 'fake witnesses', 'crisis actors' etc.) to either create 'mass movements', create paranoia or extreme fear or distract masses from real problems.

5. Use sports, celebrities and gossip, etc., to distract from real problems (and to shape public opinion).

6. Play important support role for big sponsored false flag events, hoaxes, etc. (for wars, laws, create fear, distract, etc.) Many of your favorite news anchors and journalists are indeed establishment (intelligence) officers.

7th Portra government as a victim of a crime (fraud, attack, etc.), so that the group would later protest against draconian laws against itself.

8. Producing extreme anxiety through exaggerated claims about illness, hostile power, terrorism, etc. (eg to support wars, desensitize or divide people)

9. ""Media Black Out"", or reporting with malice, (stereotyping or demonization) - the most common control technique.

10. Finally, and most secretly, the media are owned by a handful of companies and suppress other sources of information. The media form the ""matrix"" - a network of illusions to deceive the masses, and together with ""politics"" are both secretly owned by banking families.

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).
We expect an apology from you for such a mistake",CAG

2. There are Israeli citizens who are Muslims. These Muslim Israeli citizens are not allowed to enter 16 Muslim countries. Does anyone mention ""Islamaphobia"" or ""Muslim ban"" about these countries? Are you protesting at the embassies of these countries? I do not think so.

Perhaps someone you meet who accuses Trump of ""Islamaphobia"" or a ""Muslim ban"" should be made aware of the facts mentioned above. Perhaps they should also be made aware that Trump's executive order is a temporary order and not permanent like the 16 other countries that have permanent bans.

Only for the further education of those led by George Hitler Soros, here is the list of those countries that ban Israeli citizens:

"Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).
We expect an apology from you for such a mistake.",CAG

""According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement was signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India ...""

""According to the challenged agreement, 80% of water goes to Pakistan, which is a serious violation of the fundamental right of the citizens of India, coupled with further financial and natural violations of national interest.""

If we Indians stop today, our future generations will blame us and never forgive us

India, like China, has to be fast and furious and have the ability to speak up.
China claim South China Sea
China made and developed 7 artificial artificial islands on the South China Sea so fast
Why then can not India stop the water from our own states and the Union territories of India?
We have to build more dam on the Indus River and have to have Iccha-Shakti saying only one sentence to the World Bank F * ck Off
India shuts up Indus Waters contract

If China can do for her motherland
Then why not India (if India can not)
Then her serious problem is in our Indian government system with our political parties and also with our useless politician.

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).
We expect an apology from you for such a mistake",OAG

"""ARTICLE 370, INFRINGING INDIAN SOVEREIGN AND INTEGRITY""

Article 370 of the Indian Constitution in an article conferring a special autonomous status on the state of Jammu & Kashmir. (*** means Indian State Jammu & Kashmir).

The article formulated in Part xx1 of the Constitution: temporary, traditional and special provision. (**** means if the Indian Constitution or the Indian Parliament does not accept this provision, then automatically Article 370 is not a valve and not valid and to be deleted from the Indian Constitution)

Dr. Br. Ambedkar Garu, the main author of the Indian Constitution, had refused to write Article 370 (**** Dr. Br. Ambedkar Garu said Jammu & Kashmir is an integral part of India, so you do not need special autonomy)

Jammu & Kashmir Joined India on October 26, 1947, since then it was Indian State. Therefore, Article 370 needs to be deleted by the Indian Constitution for better governance.

Please repeal and please Prime Minister of India Respected Narendra Modi please note this article 370 and delete immediately in our Indian Constitution and Jammu & Kashmir State People want to respect Business Corridor, Industrial Hub and the relationship with southern and northern states these questions please take necessary step and cooperate .....

"The Sikhs are a very peace-loving community and seek no criminal retaliation against anyone. Our gurus have taught us to help other needy people regardless of their caste or beliefs. During the days of the Mughals, the Sikhs used to protect the Hindu families and their wives from the Muslims. All they expect from the government is that an appropriate and unbiased legal action be taken against the defendants to give some hope to the families of the victims, from whom they have been deprived for so many years. The government must also provide adequate money and resettlement opportunities for many of the families of victims who have lost their breadwinners in the genocide and still live in urban ghettos.

THIS EVENT REALLY FAILED THE FAITH OF THE SIKH MINORITY COMMUNITY IN THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT AND MANY OF THE FAMILIES IN QUESTION LEFT THE COUNTRY. I remember these fateful days when I was studying in Delhi at school. For the first time in my life, I felt like a minority in India. Even now, in Delhi and adjacent areas of the Hindi-speaking cow belt, Sikh's racist taunts are exposed, humiliated, and mocked at her for her unique identity. Even I was exposed to these humiliating taunts during my school days in Delhi.

Her only qualification was that she was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru was responsible for the division of India. You can read the book by Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad if you have any doubts.

It is very sad that even 27 years after the massacre of innocent Sikhs that took place between November 1 and 3, 1984, after Indira's death, no justice has been done to the victims of these vile GENOCIDE or their perpetrators (mainly local MLAs & their goons ) were tried or put to book. According to the BBC, within 4 days 20,000 SIKHS were massacred in broad daylight throughout India and the state police (like the Delhi police) did nothing to stop this brutal ETHNIC CLEANING. They just stood there like silent spectators watching the gruesome spectacle set in motion and in some cases even conspiring with the perpetrators. It is not possible to commit such a large-scale murder in such a short time without local congressional MLAs (or perhaps even senior congressional leaders) who, as in DELHI and elsewhere, murdering the mobs with vitriolic speeches, killing everyone Goons' voter lists to help them track down Sikh Homes, freely offered money, distributed guns, and offered their Goons financial rewards to kill the Sikhs, as most of these killers were illiterate. HER ELDER MINISTERS SUCH AS JAGDISH TYTLER & KAMAL NATH ARE CONNECTED IN THIS GENOCIDE. During this time, Sikhs were burned alive in front of their families, killed with iron bars and their wives raped and their places of worship ravished. For the Sikh community it was like another HOLOCAUST. There were more victims in government-controlled states (obviously). The state police became deaf to the repeated requests of the affected Sikh families for protection, as the angry mobs continued their gruesome deed in one Sikh location after another. In many Sikh communities, entire Sikh communities were wiped out. There are photos of people laughing as they beat the Sikhs to death.

I was 13 years old in Delhi when this carnage took place. I have very vivid and painful memories of those days. I am also a Sikh but luckily we were safe as our residence was in the Cantonment of Delhi, which was a safe area. Had I been in an unsafe area, I would have met the same fate. My father picked me and my sister from our school bus on October 31, 1984, as we had to walk a short distance to our house. I remember that between November 1 and 4, 1984, the entire city was under curfew and I did not go to school for a month. An eerie silence of death permeated the whole city. For the first time, I felt that I was a minority person living in a country governed by the majority society. I remember seeing black fumes coming out of nearby Janakpuri on November 1st. We had to install security guards in front of our house for a month before things calmed down, although there were threats that a mob would come to us.

The government has so far adopted (only 27 years after the carnage) only delaying tactics by forming committees to committees to intervene in these MASSES GENOCIDE, despite repeated testimonies from the families of the victims in the court, their close and dear in these riots but unfortunately JUSTICE has not been delivered yet NOW and the culprits and their thugs are still running around unscathed. It is obvious that the government is trying to shield it, and some big names are also involved.

I think the Sikh community should file suit before the International Criminal Court in The Hague because the Indian government has failed to do justice to the affected families, and as long as the current government is not there, no justice will be done. DELAYED JUSTICE IS DENIED JUSTICE. Until the Indian government advances and delivers effective justice to the victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh pogroms, I will not be surprised if this carnage is repeated again and it will remain as a dark chapter in India's HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD.",OAG

A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices.

The second time, when I tried to change the plan, I got the same answer that this is confirmed in 4 hours. Again nothing was received as confirmation or whatever. Suddenly one hour back I got a call from Chennai and said that the plan change did not happen and I was advised to contact the call center. When he was told the call center that no one could do anything, the call was forwarded to the manager and he repeated everything that the previous colleagues said, which was ultimately useless.
If I change the plan, all the benefits such as free internet packages that were there will be removed. This is the only claim and they refuse to accept the request for the plan change in-between to take effect from the next billing cycle. but earlier it was made to deduct one package, but it had an impact on the next billing cycle.
Every time they create problems, we have to suffer. Call center or language support is simply useless as we spend our precious time listening to their nonsense ... Blah and repeated automated messages.

"What you should know about Turkish President Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused 64% real GDP growth and 43% GDP per capita growth.

Erdoƒüan inherited a $ 23.5 billion debt to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new contract. Turkey's debt to the IMF was therefore declared fully paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, five-year sovereign credit default swaps hit a record low of 1.17%, below the levels of nine EU Member States and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish central bank had reserves of $ 26.5 billion. This amount reached USD 92.2 billion in 2011. During the tour of Erdoƒüan. Inflation fell in 2004 from 32% to 9.0%.

Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, a further 13500 km of motorway were built.

High-speed lines were built for the first time in Turkey's history and the country's high-speed train was put into operation in 2009. In 8 years 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway line renewed.

Erdogan has invested more in the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the Green Card program has been introduced, offering free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan increased spending on education from LR 7.5 billion in 2002 to LR 34 billion in 2011. The highest share of state budget in a ministry and the number of universities in Turkey almost doubled from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

Countries such as America, Australia and the UK took 10 years to engage in digital transactions. It will not happen in one night, thank goodness.

"The big myth about taxpayers in India Data from a chartered accountant group .......
Mr. Jetly said during his budget speech that we are largely a tax-compliant society and that only 3.7 Crisis ITRs in this poor country populate with 125 crores.

The answer from CAs:

Sir,
We have 82 Crore voters

- 75% are farmers, 61.5 crores (you have directly exempted them, but you can also buy cars, traffic jams, etc., as you quoted, and your political colleagues enjoy it too)

Balance..........
20.5 crores

Less: 24% BPL class (below the poverty line)

15 crore population (who is not a farmer and not BPL) ..

Less: seniors, non-working women, unemployed youth, under taxable income ... political class ... (say 75%) ... in a typical Indian family, only 1 income and 5/6 depend on it. ..

Balance (15-11.25) = 3.75 crores is the earning class ... the ITRs can take and ... they already fill them ....

.... almost no gap, as Mr. Jetly unnecessarily stresses, without knowing his country

if Looser Jetly wants more people to come into tax net ... then ... instead foolish resort to rampant raids, polls ... notes ... review ..... demonetization etc etc terrorism ... he should defy his negative bureaucrats and .......

1. Introduction of a simple income tax on farm incomes of large landowners (Say 10 acres plus) - You can add 26% of Agriculturists as taxpayers (politicians enjoy that as well)

2. Instead of introducing 5000/10000 penalties for late filers of IT return ...
Take a positive approach and incentivize IT retour filers (learn from Pakistan, IT Assessee receives discount on car purchases)

3. Introduce the Privilege Card for people paying taxes above a certain limit. Privilege card that offers benefits such as priority quota in train tickets, use of airport lounges, subsidized medical facilities, etc etc. * Taxpayers feel proud *

4. Introduction of health insurance / life insurance based on an average ITR salary ... such as coverage up to twice the gross income in ITR that is paid for Mediclaim, and ten times the risk coverage in the case of life insurance

5. Introduction of a pension at the age of 65 on the basis of the tax paid by the taxpayer during his working life.

Let honest taxpayers get some direct benefits ....

Like today, 3.3% of India's population fills ITRs compared to 8% of China ... Adding big farmers to income tax can shoot up the number to more than 10% .... it can help you increase your tax terrorism cool thinking and a tax-conforming nation ... üòä

I fight for peace between India and Pakistan. Because if there was no war between us, my dad would still be here. I make this video because I want the governments of both countries to stop pretending and solving the problem. If France and Germany can become friends after World War II, if Japan and the United States can leave their past behind and work towards progress, why can not we? Majority of regular Indians and Pakistanis want peace, not war. I question the caliber of leadership of both nations. We can not dream of becoming a First World country with a Third World leadership. Please pull up your socks. Talk to each other and do the work. Enough state-sponsored terrorism. Enough state-sponsored spies. Enough state-sponsored hatred.

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).

"Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).
We expect an apology from you for such a mistake.

""According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement was signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India ...""

""According to the challenged agreement, 80% of water goes to Pakistan, which is a serious violation of the fundamental right of the citizens of India, coupled with further financial and natural violations of national interest.""

If we Indians stop today, our future generations will blame us and never forgive us

India, like China, has to be fast and furious and have the ability to speak up.
China claim South China Sea
China made and developed 7 artificial artificial islands on the South China Sea so fast
Why then can not India stop the water from our own states and the Union territories of India?
We have to build more dam on the Indus River and have to have Iccha-Shakti saying only one sentence to the World Bank F * ck Off
India shuts up Indus Waters contract

If China can do for her motherland
Then why not India (if India can not)
Then her serious problem is in our Indian government system with our political parties and also with our useless politician.

It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).
We expect an apology from you for such a mistake.

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused 64% real GDP growth and 43% GDP per capita growth.

Erdoƒüan inherited a $ 23.5 billion debt to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new contract. Turkey's debt to the IMF was therefore declared fully paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).
We expect an apology from you for such a mistake.",CAG

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).
We expect an apology from you for such a mistake",OAG

"Sub: - As with the 29/11 attacks, you can not stop without solving the Kashmir problem that can not be solved without endgame in sight.

----- Throughout the history of humanity, it will be difficult to find another example where a country like India [of six times as Pakistan, especially India, with better progress in science and technology, as from 'Mangal -yan 'shows Mars mission] tolerates cowardly and helplessly repeated humiliation by armed aggression. India is faced with such a shameful situation, for the simple reason that India, like Pakistan (and Bangladesh) too foolishly does not understand that the final word on India's division still needs to be written.

One more thing arouses a person like me, who was born before the independence and also in the Kota region of my native country Rajasthan. We were raised in a culture where a 'Sainik' who laid down his life in a war was considered 'Moksha' by 'Veergati' [and we learned the stories of Rani Padmini and other ladies of Chittorgarh, the 'Sati Husbands have cut off 'Veergati' in the fight and Hada Rani (from Kota - Bundi in marriage to Chittorgarh) and sent her in memory of her 'Madhosh' husband to motivate him to fight the enemy and Rana Pratap himself never subordinating to Akabar preferred to live in the jungle as he struggled to recapture the lost forts and motherland.

This culture still remains, but today I see that the soldiers and their officers die (not in the war against Pakistan), but are called ""Keede-Makode"" (insects) and at the top ""Shaheed"" (martyrs) , do I get confused as to whether the culture we grew up in was right or the current culture? (As a veteran colonel said after 29/11 in a TV program that after training only 3 to 4 months Jihadi come under the nose of security forces on the border, etc. from Pakistan and kill the well and extensively trained and well-groomed Indian Soldiers and their officers in the Army Camp / Corps headquarters)

But in any case, it is high time that the Indian government realized that the former Congress Party and now BJP, led by PM Modi and all other political parties in India, were unable to address the Kashmir problem because of their shared mindset to solve. Therefore, before it is too late, the Indian government should save a modest $ 4,400 to launch the United India Party, which alone can solve Kashmir and other problems facing India.

It is hoped that the friends of India will force GOI to see the reason as explained:

http://www.alwihdainfo.com/At-least-after-29-11-friends-should-advice-India-to-spen---4400-to-solve-Kashmir-problem_a45603.html

[Especially given that India should not take advantage of this opportunity if some Kashmir Muslims show courage and patriotism to work with the pro-Indian National Party in Srinagar and other parts of the valley where J & K's and India's government orders are running not Pakistani-backed separatists were able to inflict nearly five months on the closure of Kashmir's population]

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines.

It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).

"Narender Modi is not a Messiah, as we all used to think, but he is just another corrupt politician who wore the mask of ""Harbinger of Good Days"". Shame on him. He does nothing except fool our innocent compatriots. Lie my points now.
When Modi was running for his party BJP (bhartiye jumla party) in 2014, he promised he would solve the case of Naxalites / Maoists. He promised that he would solve the Kashmir issue and override Article 370. He promised that he would solve OROP's problem for army men. He promised to refute Pakistan in the hardest way. He has promised that we will give young people a job / a secure career. He promised to protect every woman from monsters. He promised to eliminate corruption. He promised to make India great again. He promised to bring LokPal ... He promised to return black money from the Swiss bank ...
But it is ironic that he did exactly what he promised a few years ago. He did not even fulfill a single promise he made to us ... I think he betrayed us all ...
Our Jawans are killed by bloody Naxals / Maoists or incorrigible Pakistan. We youth are deprived of jobs by scraping many government posts and minimizing blanks. This government is absolutely anti-government jobs ... peasants commit suicide daily. ..Women are openly tortured ... Nagaland and Kashmir call for freedom and call anti-India slogans in the JNU of our national capital ... China makes CPEC through Gilgit Baltistan without worrying about our worries ..
I ask you about everything we have by choosing Mr Modi? Are not we cheated? Nevertheless, we are all happy and voting for Modi just because a few members of BJP speak against Muslims and in support of Ram Mandir ... Are not we idiots ?? Hating Muslims is the only authority that forces us to support BJP?
Please recognize the hard truth that either BJP or Modi is not the party or person we voted for ... We need to change our perception ... Our jawans on the border are mutilated and we are helpless..I am ashamed me my PM ...

"Welcome sir
Please make it pleasant to receive my experience as a self-employed. Entrepreneur:
My life with the family as He. Entrepreneur was corrupted for Dubious Actions by vengeful officials of corrupt ISI, SBI, KFC, etc.
From 1982 to 1997, they played with my life as an SSI owner.
In 1990, I tried justice by ISI and SBI through Kerala State's Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission and in 1992 filed a complaint with National CDRC, both commissions with judicial and non-judicial officers found some technical reasons to deny me justice. I had no lawyer to sue for my plight. All members of both commissions recognized the truth, but with the help of the LIMITATION Act. But my inexperience and commitment to the system, I became silent and continued efforts to revive and rehabilitate my Sick SSI unit with full cooperation of the Industries Department.
On 7.7.1995 I paid to KFC on One Time Settlement in full spirit of the letter from KFC on 23.6.95. But my inability to please the corrupt official, the unit taken over by the Revenue Recovery Act on May 30, 1995, was kept in custody by KFC.
I was in the headquarters of KFC, Trivandrum after my OTS payment, up to a traffic accident in Palauan via Trivandrum on 6.3.97.
I was treated by the Medical College Trivandrum, the Kannur District Hospital, the City Hospital Mangalore, etc., and at least in 1997 I visited KFC HO with the help of crutches and realized that instead of blood blood flows through the officials and the same day I visited the Kerala State CDRC and filed a complaint against KFC the next day. After three months, the Commission received a reply from KFC with a copy to me. On the basis of KFC's response, the Commission began to dictate the verdict and dismiss my complaint to Sue in the civil court.
The next day, I submitted a review petition alongside a few others. The Hearing Day, when I stood with the help of crutches and started expressing my opinion, threatened the President of the Commission with enormous costs to be ordered against me. I managed to escape the so-called consumer court with fear.
But I still know that someone of common sense will give me justice in both cases by the state and state CDRCs.
After 1977 to 2009 I had an acute mental depression.
I started writing to Central and State Governments, handing over 5 pages of GO, in 2010 directly to KFC, to resolve board-level issues and write to various ministries of the Indian government to call me over for Dubious Actions by ISI and SBI ask and compensate.
But my efforts continue, the corrupt officials resist my efforts even in my 67th year.
What we understand from the summary of the plight
The officials have a good salary and support from all government cadres to protect corrupt ones with the support of the so-called commission before judicial and quasi-judicial ones such as CDRCs, human rights commissions, etc.

My plight covered by Malayalam Manorama, the Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc .. and are on my face book account.
In the last few days, should I wait for a speedy judicial review by the competent authorities, which will effectively establish new safeguards for self-employed contacts and prevent those bad experiences that I and my family suffer?

In the next few days after the delivery of the car, I noticed some cloudy parts and blisters on the driver and passenger door of the car.

After 15 days the same problem recurred. When I drove my car to the dealer (One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow - 226005), they sent it to the gas station for repair and handed the car over to me after two days.

The same problem was found again on 13-02-2017. After only 20 days again, d. H. 24.02.2017, the same problem was found on the entire body of the vehicle.

When I visited the car dealership's authorized gas station again, they refused to solve the problem and behaved badly with me.

It's not just about luck or not. Of course that can be one of the possibilities. However, there are many women in this world who are happy enough to be at home and stay with their children. And they decide to still be working moms. That's because they were raised to be independent and raise their children to be the same.

They neither run away from their children nor neglect them. They just want them to be the best in every situation, be it luck or not.

So, be proud of yourself, working moms. You are creating a better world for you and for me and the whole world. :)",CAG

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).

"What you should know about Turkish President Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused 64% real GDP growth and 43% GDP per capita growth.

Erdoƒüan inherited a $ 23.5 billion debt to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new contract. Turkey's debt to the IMF was therefore declared fully paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, five-year sovereign credit default swaps hit a record low of 1.17%, below the levels of nine EU Member States and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish central bank had reserves of $ 26.5 billion. This amount reached USD 92.2 billion in 2011. During the tour of Erdoƒüan. Inflation fell in 2004 from 32% to 9.0%.

Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, a further 13500 km of motorway were built.

High-speed lines were built for the first time in Turkey's history and the country's high-speed train was put into operation in 2009. In 8 years 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway line renewed.

Erdogan has invested more in the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the Green Card program has been introduced, offering free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan increased spending on education from LR 7.5 billion in 2002 to LR 34 billion in 2011. The highest share of state budget in a ministry and the number of universities in Turkey almost doubled from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

In 1996 1 $ = 222 lira and in 2016 1 $ = 2.94 lira, even after the recent turmoil.",OAG

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).

"Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).
We expect an apology from you for such a mistake.

[200] The Hamoodur Rahman wrote Commission ""indiscriminate killing and looting could only serve the cause of the enemies of Pakistan. The rate we lost the support of the silent majority of the people of East Pakistan ... The Comilla Cantonment massacre (on 27./21 March, 1971) under the command of the CO 53 field regiment, Lt.

Secondly, I have heard from many non-Muslims that Muslims should kill Muslims wherever they find them, although this is a misunderstanding that I would like to clarify here; A verse in the Qur'an was revealed during a war in the time of the Prophet Mohammad, where Muslims were commanded to kill their enemies but did no harm to children and women who might possibly be there for some reason, places not to start a war before they harm you. This verse was revealed only for that particular time. There is no verse in the Koran restricting a Muslim to be a friend of non-Muslims or to kill someone who is not a Muslim.

"Tiger: If you have problems with Muslim Azan, you also need to have problems with Hindu Aarti. Both cause noise pollution.

Agniverer: There are differences.

1. How many times have you been awakening in temples at 4:30 am due to the noise of Hindu Aarti? Zero.

How many times have you woken up in mosques at 4:30 am due to the noise of Azan? 365 times a year (if you live within 5 km of a mosque).

Zero vs 365 does it all.

Even if the Aarti loudspeaker near you starts at 4:30 am at full volume, you can just go to the priest and he will reduce it. Just try a Moulvi in ‚Äã‚Äãa mosque and see if you come back in one piece.

Tiger: Huh, and what about your Ganesh Yatra, Hanuman Yatra? Do not they make noise? Stop her.

Agniverer: How often do Ganesh Chaturthi and Hanuman Jayanti come in one year?

Tiger: At least 10 days.

Agniverer: And how often does Azan happen on speakers in a year?

Tiger:

Agniverer: Why quiet? Let me help you. 365 * 5 = 1825. And then there are rallies, bike stunts, processions, etc. on the Prophet's B'day, Eid, and Muharram.

So it's 10 against 1825+. Are 10 and 1825 the same?

Tiger: Wrong is wrong. There is no greater or less wrong.

Agniverer: Okay, then your 34/36/38 waist size is also wrong. Come to us before commenting on our concerns about Azan.

Tiger: How can you compare my personal fitness problem with a problem of 20% minorities?

Agniverer: Just as you compared 10 to 1825+.

Tiger:

Agniverer: Why quiet?

Tiger: Look, you can not interfere with the religion of others. India is a multicultural society. Every religion has equal rights.

Agniverer: Equal rights? Are we equal? A Muslim can marry 4 women at the same time and divorce at will. A Hindu is imprisoned for it. Where are the same rights? And where are the same rights for Muslim women? You only need equal rights for noise. And you do not care about the plight of 10 crore Muslim women?

Look, same rights have equal responsibilities. You follow the same laws, you get the same rights. You act as a special hero, your a $$ is kicked.

And finally, there is a big difference. There is a strong correlation between the density of Azan and terror. Find the places on earth where

1. Azan is maximum (let's call it # 1)
2. Aarti is maximum (let's call it 2nd place)

Then find out how many top terrorists / terrorist organizations in the world are producing Group 1 and Group 2.

This is the ultimate litmus test where noise is dangerous and harmless.

Tiger:

Agniverer: Why quiet?

Tiger: Who are you man?

Agniverer: A proud Hindu. A proud idol worshiper. A proud jihadi hater. A proud Indian. Agniverer is the name.

Trump: Why is that?

CIA: India will cut off Balochistan from Pak.

Trump: I do not care.

CIA: India will have peace in Kashmir. They will stop buying our weapons. You will become a superpower. We have to finance Pakistan to keep India busy in Kashmir.

Trump: But you have to destroy the Taliban.

CIA: Sir, we can not do that. We created the Taliban to keep Russia at bay in the 1980s. Now they keep Pakistan busy and away from their nuclear bombs.

Trump: We have to destroy terrorist regimes in the Middle East. Let's start with the Saudis.

Pentagon: Sir, we can not do that. We created these regimes because we wanted their oil. We can not have democracy there, otherwise their people will get that oil - and we can not let their people own it.

Trump: Then let's invade Iran.

Pentagon: We can not, sir.

Trump: Why not?

CIA: We're talking to you, sir.

Trump: What? Why?

CIA: We want our stealth drones back. If we attack them, Russia will wipe us out like our buddy ISIS in Syria. We also need Iran to keep Israel at bay.

Trump: Then let's invade Iraq again.

CIA: Sir, our friends (ISIS) already occupy 1/3 of Iraq.

Trump: Why not all Iraq?

CIA: We need the Shiite government in Iraq to keep the IS at bay.

Trump: I forbid Muslims to enter the US.

FBI: We can not do that.

Trump: Why not?

FBI: Then our own population will become fearless.

Trump: I'm deporting all illegal immigrants south of the border.

Border Patrol: You can not do that, sir.

Trump: Why not?

Border patrol: When they are gone, who will build the wall?

Trump: I ban H1B visas.

USCIS: You can not do that.

Trump: Why?

Chief of Staff: If you do that, we'll have to outsource White House operations to Bangalore. What is in India?

Trump (now sweating): What the hell am I supposed to do as President?

CIA: Enjoy the White House, sir! We take care of the rest!

A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).

""According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement was signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India ...""

""According to the challenged agreement, 80% of water goes to Pakistan, which is a serious violation of the fundamental right of the citizens of India, coupled with further financial and natural violations of national interest.""

If we Indians stop today, our future generations will blame us and never forgive us

India, like China, has to be fast and furious and have the ability to speak up.
China claim South China Sea
China made and developed 7 artificial artificial islands on the South China Sea so fast
Why then can not India stop the water from our own states and the Union territories of India?
We have to build more dam on the Indus River and have to have Iccha-Shakti saying only one sentence to the World Bank F * ck Off
India shuts up Indus Waters contract

If China can do for her motherland
Then why not India (if India can not)
Then her serious problem is in our Indian government system with our political parties and also with our useless politician.

"Kevin Gaskin. You are welcome to search the Bill of Rights, the US Constitution, and the Declaration of Independence, but you will find nothing about the ""separation of church and state"" in one of them.

Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802 to answer a letter from them asking why he would not announce national Lenten and Thanksgiving holidays, as Washington and Adams had done before him. The letter contains the phrase ""wall of separation between church and state"" that led to the erroneous ""shorthand"" for the Establishment Clause (US Constitution, Bill of Rights, Amendment I, Article III) that we use today.

""Why do I have religious freedom ...?"" The answer lay in the congressional papers relating to our constitution, as we know it today. The process of drafting the first amendment has made clear the intention of the founders; Because before they adopted the final text, the First Amendment went through almost a dozen different iterations and in-depth discussions.

""We do not want in America what we had in the UK: we do not want a nation to lead the nation, we will not all be Catholics or Anglicans or any other denomination, we want God's principles, but we do not want a nation the nation rules. ""

This intention was well understood as evidence by court judgments under the First Amendment. In 1799, the court stated, ""According to our form of government, the Christian religion is the established religion, and all the sects and denominations of Christians are equal.""

It is important to realize that our founding fathers sought to gain ""religious freedom"" because of the oppressive authority of the Roman Catholic Church. It was not just Great Britain, but the largest part of Europe that came under the authority of Roman Catholicism. Our founding fathers began to recognize the many denominations of Christianity. In addition, they intended to recognize each denomination as equivalent, as opposed to granting control by any denomination. Herein lies the misinterpretation of the reckless ""shorthand,"" known as ""separation of church and state.""

A more accurate statement is likely to be ""Separation of church and state denominations"". Such an interpretation is clear from the papers of Congress regarding the statement ""We do not want what we had in the UK in America: we do not want a denomination that leads the nation, we will not all be Catholics or Anglicans or any other denomination We want God's principles, but we do not want a nation to rule the nation. ""

As for the statement, ""Most of our founding fathers were agnostic,"" that's simply not true. It is a general statement made by those who oppose religion in general. Yes, at that time there were agnostics, but they were not nearly as widespread as claimed. Thomas Paine was an Anglo-American political activist, philosopher, political theorist and revolutionary. Although he is considered one of our founding fathers, he was shunned because of his well-known agnostic convictions.

John Adams is falsely accused of being an agnostic. But here is a quote from President Adams regarding Thomas Paine; ""The Christian religion is above all the religions that ever ruled or existed, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equality and humanity. Let Black King Paine say what he wants."" I believe you will agree with his words regarding Mr. Paine are more than sufficient to dispel claims of his agnostic convictions.",NAG

""According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement was signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India ...""

""According to the challenged agreement, 80% of water goes to Pakistan, which is a serious violation of the fundamental right of the citizens of India, coupled with further financial and natural violations of national interest.""

If we Indians stop today, our future generations will blame us and never forgive us

India, like China, has to be fast and furious and have the ability to speak up.
China claim South China Sea
China made and developed 7 artificial artificial islands on the South China Sea so fast
Why then can not India stop the water from our own states and the Union territories of India?
We have to build more dam on the Indus River and have to have Iccha-Shakti saying only one sentence to the World Bank F * ck Off
India shuts up Indus Waters contract

If China can do for her motherland
Then why not India (if India can not)
Then her serious problem is in our Indian government system with our political parties and also with our useless politician.

"Q1) Are GDP data misused?

- Yes they are. They are not accurate. They are abused to promote a lie.

Q2) Can you prove that GDP data is misused?

- By January 2015, the Indian economy had been experiencing valuable growth since the mid-1980s. And then the magic happened. The Central Statistical Office (CSO) has changed the calculation of GDP, stating that this is necessary in the light of global practices. As a result, India overtook China and became the fastest growing economy. In 2013-2014, our economy grew 6.9% instead of 4.7% as the CSO data showed earlier. Arvind Subramanian, the country's top economic advisor, said, ""I'm confused about the new GDP growth figures."" The revised figures show that GDP growth in 2012-2013 increased from 4.7% to 5.1% and for 2013-2013. From 5% to 6.9% in 2014. This means an acceleration in GDP growth of 1.9 percentage points in 2013-2014, simply by comparing the new numbers over time. ""These figures, in particular the acceleration in 2013- 2014, are at odds with other macroeconomic features ""Almost every economist working inside or outside the government (including Mr. Raghuram Rajan) questioned GDP figures as land conditions reflected a completely different picture. Figures seemed completely at odds with other economic indicators According to R Nagraj, an independent member of the subcommittee, who is investigating the new methodology for estimating production The version adopted by the Central Stability Organization was significantly different from the report finalized by the Subcommittee in September 2014.

Q3) What about the latest GDP data released after demonetization?

- You are also deceived. While the performance of a few sectors was better than in previous quarters, the huge improvement in private consumption (almost doubled) seems very doubtful given the cash crunch during demonetization. It seems that the CSO was unable to reproduce the demonetisation effect in its data. Both the government and the RBI have said (as well as few of their judicious critics) that the effects of demonetization can be replicated over a longer period of time. The CSO also revised the Q3 estimates for 2015/16 by 0.3 percentage points to 6.9% from 7.2% previously, leading to a significant improvement in the third quarter 2016/17 figures. For those who find it unsurprising, the CSO revised the 2015-16 UP Q1 and Q2 estimates. This downward revision in the third quarter of 2015-16 has helped to limit the effect of demonetization in numbers.

Q4) I can not understand anything. Why?

- You will not get it. You are neither a statistician nor an economist. Every time reports and statements like these emerge, they push themselves a little on the internet beyond Facebook and Twitter and read about basic things and what experts have to say about them.

Q5) But Modi Ji says experts do not know anything. Do not you think he's right?

- According to Hindutva, the best tactic modes ji has is a misinformation. He has convinced people that experts do not know anything. He misinterprets people who know nothing but believe him. They do not have enough time or will to find out the truth. And when experts question his allegations and him, people never understand what experts say because they are not educated enough to understand.",CAG

"What you should know about Turkish President Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused 64% real GDP growth and 43% GDP per capita growth.

Erdoƒüan inherited a $ 23.5 billion debt to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new contract. Turkey's debt to the IMF was therefore declared fully paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, five-year sovereign credit default swaps hit a record low of 1.17%, below the levels of nine EU Member States and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish central bank had reserves of $ 26.5 billion. This amount reached USD 92.2 billion in 2011. During the tour of Erdoƒüan. Inflation fell in 2004 from 32% to 9.0%.

Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, a further 13500 km of motorway were built.

High-speed lines were built for the first time in Turkey's history and the country's high-speed train was put into operation in 2009. In 8 years 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway line renewed.

Erdogan has invested more in the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the Green Card program has been introduced, offering free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan increased spending on education from LR 7.5 billion in 2002 to LR 34 billion in 2011. The highest share of state budget in a ministry and the number of universities in Turkey almost doubled from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

"Cow in Hinduism:

Eating beef (Cow Mata) is allowed in Hinduism.
Rigveda (10/85/13) explains: ""On the occasion of a girl's wedding, oxen and cows are slaughtered.""
Rigveda (6/17/1) states that ""Indra ate the meat of cow, calf, horse and buffalo"".
Manusmriti (chapter 5 / verse 30) says, ""It is not sinful to eat meat from edible animals, for Brahma created both the eaters and the edible.""
Maharishi Yagyavalkya says in Shatpath Brahman (3/1/2/21): ""I eat beef because it is very soft and delicious.""
Apastamb Grihsutram (1/3/10) says: ""The cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest on the occasion of the 'Shraddha' of the ancestors and on the occasion of a wedding.""

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).

"The big myth about taxpayers in India Data from a chartered accountant group .......
Mr. Jetly said during his budget speech that we are largely a tax-compliant society and that only 3.7 Crisis ITRs in this poor country populate with 125 crores.

The answer from CAs:

Sir,
We have 82 Crore voters

- 75% are farmers, 61.5 crores (you have directly exempted them, but you can also buy cars, traffic jams, etc., as you quoted, and your political colleagues enjoy it too)

Balance..........
20.5 crores

Less: 24% BPL class (below the poverty line)

15 crore population (who is not a farmer and not BPL) ..

Less: seniors, non-working women, unemployed youth, under taxable income ... political class ... (say 75%) ... in a typical Indian family, only 1 income and 5/6 depend on it. ..

Balance (15-11.25) = 3.75 crores is the earning class ... the ITRs can take and ... they already fill them ....

.... almost no gap, as Mr. Jetly unnecessarily stresses, without knowing his country

if Looser Jetly wants more people to come into tax net ... then ... instead foolish resort to rampant raids, polls ... notes ... review ..... demonetization etc etc terrorism ... he should defy his negative bureaucrats and .......

1. Introduction of a simple income tax on farm incomes of large landowners (Say 10 acres plus) - You can add 26% of Agriculturists as taxpayers (politicians enjoy that as well)

2. Instead of introducing 5000/10000 penalties for late filers of IT return ...
Take a positive approach and incentivize IT retour filers (learn from Pakistan, IT Assessee receives discount on car purchases)

"Hindus, with full support from their religious writings, especially ""MANUSMRITI,"" have inflicted terrible torture on their Womenfolk & sacral Dalits for years ... In order to promote the rape of children, girls used to be married to aged Hindu men before adolescence. .. Polygamy was practiced by most Hindu men, especially Brahmans, such as Tiwaris, Dubeys, Choubeys, etc. ... With the religion at their side, some of them married more than 100 Hindu women, even at the deathbed (infamous Antarjali Yatra) ... After the death of old husbands, the newly married girls were made ""SATI"" by throwing them on their husband's pyre ...
A Bengali movie called ""Antarjali Jatra"" directed by the famous director Goutam Ghose was released in 1987. This film describes the evil practices in Kulin Brahmanism such as Polygamy & ... 'SATI Practice', in which a recently widowed woman would be burned at her husband's funeral pyre.

Previously, WIDOWS imposed all sorts of restrictions ... on ""food intake"", ""remarriage of teenage widows"", ""right to property"", ""social status"", ""rest"" and so on, while no restriction on any kind was made earlier WIDOWERS imposed!
Nowadays, Hindus mock the ""burka"" used by Muslims ... But ask some Hindu why the hell do they keep their mother-of-women grandma under the ""GHUNGHAT"" or force her women to use vermilion (SINDOOR / BINDI), if the married Hindu men do not use ... they would become speechless!

Not to mention the ordinary, even the goddess Sita had to appear for a fiery test to prove his ""purity"", she was left by Hindu god Ramchandra when she was pregnant and was forced to live in the Hermitage of Valmiki. After all, she had to commit suicide ... In the same way, Lord Krishna never married 'Radha' and left her and never met her again after leaving Mathura for Dwarka! Although he had 16,100 younger women, except 8 Principal Queens!

Have the courage to name a single Hindu whose great-grandfather / grandma was not raped by his G. Grandpa / Grand-Pa when she was a child and made her produce children like a hare !!

Let me finally admit that I myself am a devout Hindu!
