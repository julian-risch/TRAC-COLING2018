Now the people of the state of J & K are excited and the infiltrators disoriented them. For 10 days I received thousands of responses received from people from the state of J & K and some people from Pakistan, which was where I wrote the thesis, regarding intolerance in the state j & k.

Here some people depend on terrorist and MILITENT organizations in Pakistan and other anti national elements. Now people are making a rain of stones in the Army and the Police and they raised slogans in favor of the Anti National attitude and wearing ISIS suits and with Pakistan flags.

J & K State students need to get admissions in South India Collages because there is no mutual understanding and interaction between j & k state and South states, in my verdict this is the great salvation for intolerance.

Needs marriage proposals between the south and the north with j & k state people.

J & K State Suffers from Lober Facts and implementations because there is no road map for life to survive with good opportunities This is the main problem at J & K State that is why teens follow an illegal Law.

You need Industrial Hub in the state of J & K to get better profits.

I ask the MODI Ji Prime Minister to bring the new reforms for the j & k state for a better future for our citizens ... Jai Hind

"Doucett Black Your atheism is out of place in this Christian nation where you live.

Before wasting time extracting all the fallacy of ""separation of Church and State,"" consider the words of James Madison, the Father of Our Constitution:

""We have wagered the set of all our political institutions on the capacity of humanity for self-government, on the ability of each and every one of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves in accordance with the Ten Commandments of God.""

The author of our Constitution left no doubt about how to govern us according to the Ten Commandments of God. Congress further registers Christianity as the established religion of these United States of America:

The process of drafting the First Amendment made the intention of the Founders very clear; Before they approved the final draft, the First Amendment went through almost a dozen different iterations and extensive discussions.

""We do not want in the United States what we had in Britain: we do not want a denomination with the Nation, we will not all be Catholics, Anglicans or any other denomination, we want the principles of God, but we do not want a single denomination managing the Nation"".

This attempt was well understood, as evidenced by court rulings after the First Amendment. In 1799 the court declared: ""By our form of government, the Christian religion is the established religion, and all sects and denominations of Christians are placed on an equal footing.""

The US Almanac UU., Although it is a respected publication, it does not constitute the maximum authority. Our Founding Fathers, speaking through the Constitution of the United States, have that authority. The Supreme Law of the Land confirms its position on the issues in question, as demonstrated by the Supreme Court of the United States.

I would have had additional income to allow the granting of personal taxes.

Since independence, the salaried class is the surest source of tax revenues and, therefore, of the government. I decided to take him for a walk for another moment.

For a moment I was stunned; Maybe like a lot of his passionate supporters. Why BJP will commit a harakiri, antagonize the minority, provide control for a section of media and opposition to mount an attack with renewed vigor and rejoicing (I already told you!) Will it damage your reputation and put a question mark on your development agenda? ?
But knowing Modi and Amit Shah, their ability to think far ahead of the rest, I think they have a game plan with far-reaching consequences that will pay them a rich dividend in the line's electoral battles.
Let us suppose that for the next 2 years they ensure a splendid model of governance with high growth and peace, together with an impartial administration, bury the ghost and the label of ""communal"" neutralize and silence critics once and for all. If the epitome of the 'monster' on the right can make this paradigm change, then they will be able to court the minorities in their bosom, which they have not been able to do until now.

"Respected Mr. Minister MINISTER Lord,
Please make it convenient to start the repair of pending grievances.
My life with the family as Er. The businessman has been spoiled due to dubious actions by vengeful officials of corrupt ISI, SBI, KFC, etc.
From 1982 to 1997, they have played with my life as the owner of an SSI unit.
During 1990, I tried justice for ISI and SBI through the Commission of Rejection of Consumer Conflicts of the State of Kerala and in 1992, an appeal filed with National CDRC, both Commissions with Judicial and Non-Judicial Officers found some technical reasons to deny me Justice. I did not have a lawyer to sue my situation. All the members of both Commissions realized the truth, but with the help of the LIMITATION Law. But due to my inexperience and obligation to the system, I kept silent and continued the efforts to revive and rehabilitate my Sick SSI unit with the full cooperation of the Department of Industries.
On 7.7.1995, I paid KFC in One Time Settlement with all the spirit of the KFC letter dated 23.6.95. But my inability to please the corrupt Officials, the unit assumed by the Revenue Recovery Act on 30.5.95 remained with the custody of KFC.
I was at the KFC headquarters, Trivandrum after my OTS payment, until a traffic accident in Palauan on Trivandrum on 6.3.97.
I was under treatment from Medical College Trivandrum, Kannur District Hospital, City Hospital Mangalore, etc. and at least in 1997, I visited KFC HO with the help of crutches, and I noticed that instead of blood, the water flows through the officials and on the same day I visited the CDRC of the State of Kerala and the next day presented a complaint against KFC. After three months, the Commission received a response from KFC with a copy for me. On the basis of KFC's response, the Commission began to issue a Judgment and dismissed my Complaint, directing Sue to the Civil Court.
The next day, I filed a Petition for review in addition to a few others. On the Day of the Hearing, when I stopped with the help of crutches and began to express my point of view, the President of the Commission threatened to pay a huge cost against me. I managed to escape the so-called Consumer Court with fear.
But I still know that anyone who has common sense will grant me justice from the national and state CDRC in both cases.
Then, from 1977 to 2009, he was under acute mental depression.
I started writing to Central and State Governments and spent 5 pages G O, in 2010 I direct KFC to resolve issues at the Board level and I write to several Government Ministries of India to ask and compensate me due to dubious actions by ISI and SBI.
But my efforts continue, the corrupt Officials also continue resisting my efforts at 67 years of age.
What we understand by the synopsis of the difficult situation
Officials have a good salary and support of all government cadres to save the corrupt with the support of the so-called Provision in both judicial and quasi-judicial courts, such as CDRC, Human Rights Commissions, etc.

My situation is covered by Malayalam Manorama, The Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc. and they are in my account of the book of my face.
Should I expect prompt justice from the authorities involved in my last days and that will be illuminated in an effective way for the formation of new security measures for employees on their own and to prevent those bad experiences that I and my family suffer?

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted way just to make some sensationalist headlines. The news about the next singer Nahid Afreen have been prepared without proper investigation and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand the religious guidelines, while the leaflet that is being distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a hard copy of a signed appeal by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first of all, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"Margaux S Milchen.The Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the United States of America and the Bey and the subjects of Tripoli de Barbary, signed at Tripoli on November 4, 1796, Article 11 was established as a matter of controversy between the translations to English and Arabic of the Treaty. Adams criticized claims to universal authority made by the Roman Catholic Church, which may well be the basis on which the wording of Article 11 was based.

While it is true that Adams signed the aforementioned Treaty, it should be noted that he also signed the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights; both serve to further support Adams' words as misunderstood. That the Congress has unanimously signed the Treaty is absurd when one recognizes the problem of full translation.

John Adams was a devout Christian and an independent thinker. In a letter to Benjamin Rush, Adams attributed to religion the success of his ancestors since his migration to the New World in the 1630s. He also believed that the regular service of the church was beneficial to the moral sense of man. In 1796, Adams denounced the deistic criticism of political critic Thomas Paine to Christianity in The Age of Reason, saying: ""The Christian religion is, above all religions that once prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let Blackguard Paine say what he wants "".

In the light of Adams's Christianity, it is very unlikely that translations from English to Arabic were accurately transcribed. It is much more plausible that he rejected the claims of ""universal authority"" proclaimed by the Roman Catholic Church than anything remotely dismissing the foundation on the Christian religion.

Adams served twice as Vice President under President George Washington. The words of our esteemed first president, included in his farewell speech, refute even more any idea that these United States of America are not founded on the Christian religion; ""And let us cautiously suppose that morality can be maintained without religion: whatever is granted to the influence of a refined education in minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience forbid us to hope that national morality can prevail in the exclusion of the religious principles. ""

The words of James Madison, the father of our Constitution, clearly contradict the idea that the United States is not a Christian nation; ""We have wagered the set of all our political institutions on the capacity of humanity for self-government, on the ability of each and every one of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves in accordance with the Ten Commandments of God.""

While Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States. UU., They have not yet earned Statehood. Indigenous languages ‚Äã‚Äãstill have to prevail over English in any of our States. Their argument is debatable until such time as they obtain such statehood. We are all very aware that the United States is not Israel; repeating the obvious does not make sense, especially when it is irrelevant to the point in question. Maybe it's you who ""should read more?""",NAG

"What you should know about the President of Turkey, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a 64% growth in real GDP and an increase of 43% in GDP per capita.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $ 23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Thus it was stated that Turkey's debt to the IMF was fully paid and announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, the five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.

In 2002, the Central Bank of Turkey had $ 26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $ 92.2 billion in 2011. During the leadership of Erdoƒüan. Inflation fell from 32% to 9% in 2004.

Under the Erdoƒüan government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of highways were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high-speed rail lines were built, and the country's high-speed rail service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railways were built and 5449 km of railway tracks were renovated.

Erdogan invested more in the health system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan increased education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion in 2011, the largest share of the national budget awarded to a ministry and the number of universities in Turkey almost doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012 .

In 1996, 1 ‚Äã‚Äã$ = 222 lire and in 2016 1 $ = 2,94 lire, even after the recent upheaval.",NAG

If by ""appeasement"" you mean the appeasement of mulism.
Who are the most backward in this country? Muslim
Why do you ask? Communal prejudice, ghettoization, persecution repeated.etc
Just for your information, Muslims are even more backward than the Dalits, SC, ST's, even the non-Hindus SC / ST (Tribal's). In fact, the backward, poorer and ghetto community in India is Muslim.
When the issues of these communities are bought in the parliament, nobody is opposed. Except Jat, Patel, Tamil, SC, Dalit, Zoroastrian, Sikh, but if you talk about the conditions of Indian citizens who are Muslims, then their appeasement constitutes 14.2% of the population of India.",CAG

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted way just to make some sensationalist headlines. The news about the next singer Nahid Afreen have been prepared without proper investigation and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand the religious guidelines, while the leaflet that is being distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a hard copy of a signed appeal by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first of all, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

The following days after the delivery of the car, I noticed some cloudy parts and bubbles in the driver and the passenger door of the car. then I spoke with the dealer about the problem they noticed the problem and I sent my car to the authorized service station of Maruti Suzuki on 02-01-2017 to solve the problem.

After 15 days, the same problem was repeated. When I took my car to the dealership (One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow - 226005) they sent it back to the service station to rectify the problems and they gave me the car after two days.

The same problem was noticed again on 02-13-2017. After only 20 days again, that is, 02/24/17, the same problem has been noticed in the whole body of the car.

When I go back to the dealer's authorized service station, they refused to solve the problem and behaved badly to me.

Today, that is, on 03.23.2017 My car is still under repair with Oneup Moters Arambagh of the last 20 days.

I took the car to use it to my parents and I did not send it repeatedly to the service station to repair it or solve problems. My father is suffering from problems ‚ù§ heart. As you know, it is very difficult for seniors or to repeatedly visit the service station.",NAG

When Anna keeps silent about Lokpal and vocalizes against AK, it seems that Anna feels pain and anguish for her own failure and speaks against AK just because she is known and easily accessible to him.
I think Anna comments when a paid medium comes out to pressure him to speak against AK when something like a political fight in Delhi between Aap and BJP happens. Anna must look at the political struggle and corruption separately before commenting to the media.

"Undeniable facts about Muslim extremism:

Direct quotations from the Koran:
1. Koran: 4/89: ""They wish you did not believe because they did not believe you are the same, so do not take from them allies until they emigrate for the sake of Allah. But if they go away, grab them and kill them wherever they go. find them and do not give them any ally or assistant ""[Link: https://quran.com/4/89] Translation: Kill all Muslims who leave Islam.
2. Quran: 2/1: ""Alif, Lam, Meem."" [Link: https://quran.com/2/1] Translation: Allah and his messengers are always right, and you can not doubt the Koran. ""
3. Koran: 8/12: ""[Remember] when your Lord inspired the angels,"" I am with you, so strengthen those who have believed. I will cast terror in the hearts of those who do not believe, so hit them ""over the necks and hit from each end of the finger"". [Link: https://quran.com/8/12, https: // quran .com / 8/60] Translation: terrorize all non-believers and people who do not agree with Islam
4. Koran: 98/6: ""Indeed, those who did not believe between the People of the Scripture and the polytheists will be in the fire of Hell, remaining eternally in it, these are the worst creatures."" [Link: https://quran.com/98/6] Translation: ""The people of the Scriptures (Jews, Christians and sages) and polytheists (Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains) are all the vilest of the creatures that they do not deserve mercy. ""
5. Koran: 4/3: ""And if you fear not treating orphaned girls with justice, then marry those you like [other] women, two or three or four, but if you fear not being fair, then [ marry alone] with one or with your right hand It is more appropriate not to incline [to injustice]. ""[Link: https://quran.com/4/3] Translation:"" Two, three, four. ..! ""
6. Quran: 5/51: ""Oh you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies, they are [in fact] allies of each other, and whoever is an ally for them among you, then in fact, he is [one] of them, in fact, Allah does not guide the people who do evil. "" [Link: https://quran.com/5/51] Translation: ""Do not make Jewish and Christian friends""
7. Koran: 2/216: ""You have been forced to fight while you are hateful, but maybe you hate something and it's good for you, and maybe you love something and it's bad for you. And Allah knows, while you do not you know ""[Link: https://quran.com/2/216] Translation:"" Fighting [Jihad] is an obligation of Muslims, even if you do not want to do it ""
8. Koran: 3/85: ""And whoever desires anything other than Islam as a religion, will never be accepted by him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers ..."" [Link: https: // quran . com / 3/85] Translation: ""Islam is the only acceptable religion""

"Why India should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty
The Indus Water Treaty is illegal
The case of the treaty on the waters of the Indus of 1960, has been signed by the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ""nowhere is it stated that such agreement / treaty has been signed on behalf of the President of India"",
""According to the documents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jawaharlal Nehru has signed an agreement nowhere for the president of India ...""

""According to the contested agreement, 80% of the water goes to Pakistan, which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India, along with other financial and natural injuries of national interest.""

If we Indians surrender today, our future generations will blame us and never forgive us

India needs to be like China fast and furious and must have the ability to say in the face.
China claims the South China Sea
China made and developed 7 artificial man-made islands in the South China Sea so quickly
So, why can not India stop the water from our own states and territories of the Union of India?
We need to build more dams on the Indus River and we must ask Iccha-Shakti to say a single sentence to the World Bank. F * ck Off
India is scraping the Indus Water Treaty

If China can do for its mother land
So why not India? (If India can not do)
So, this is a serious problem in our Indian government system with our political parties and also with our useless politician.
Who only knows how to bark but can not act.

"How to turn all your black money into white in 4 perfectly ""legal"" simple steps?
Answer:-
-> Step 1: create a political party and register under the People Representation Act of 1951. [It is not a difficult task. There are more than 1000 registered parties that did not even participate in the 2014 Lok Sabha Election, and EC can not cancel the registration of a match]
-> Step 2: Donate all the black money to your party in parts, each part must be less than 20,000. You can make endless donations and say that they come from people.
[According to the RP Law of 1951, political parties are not obliged to inform (to the Election Commission of India (ECI)) the name of the persons or organizations from which they have received donations for an amount less than Rs .20,000.]
-> Step 3 - Go to the bank, deposit all this amount in the account of the part.
[It is not necessary to pay any income tax. Political parties are 100% exempt from income tax]
-> Step 4: withdraw the amount when you need it, in 50/100/500/2000 rupee notes: everything is white.
[Since Political Parties are not subject to RTI, you can not ask them how they spent their money]
ENJOY YOUR WEALTH ... !!!!
* Moral of the story: - All political parties are the same. All they do is follow the law as the previous example and kill the spirit that is politically correct but ethically incorrect. But in the process, we teach you how you can legally generate enormous wealth and still talk about ideals and concern for poor people.

A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand the religious guidelines, while the leaflet that is being distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a hard copy of a signed appeal by 46 men who believe in religious practices.

"Pigeral: If you have problems with Muslim Azan, then you should have a problem with Hindu Aarti as well. Both cause noise pollution.

Agniveer: There is a difference.

1. How many times have you woken up at 4:30 in the morning due to the noise of the Hindu Aarti in the temples? Zero.

How many times have you woken up at 4:30 in the morning due to the noise of Azan in the mosques? 365 times in a year (if you live within a 5 km radius of a mosque).

Zero vs 365 fixes everything.

Even if the Aarti speaker in your town starts at 4:30 at full volume, you can simply go to the priest and he will reduce it. Just try to do it with a Moulvi in ‚Äã‚Äãa mosque and see if you come back in one piece.

Pigeral: Eh, and what about your Ganesh Yatra, Hanuman Yatra? Do not they make noise? Stop them.

Agniveer: How many times in a year do Ganesh Chaturthi and Hanuman Jayanti come?

Pigeral: at least 10 days.

Agniveer: And how many times does Azan happen on the loudspeaker in a year?

Pigeral:

Agniveer: why silence? Let 'me help you. 365 * 5 = 1825. And then, in addition, there are rallies, bike stunts, processions, etc. in Prophet's B'Day, Eid and Muharram, etc.

Then it's 10 vs 1825+. Are 10 and 1825 the same?

Pigeral: The incorrect is wrong. There are no bigger or smaller mistakes.

Agniveer: Ok, your waist size 34/36/38 is also incorrect. Get in shape before commenting on our concerns about Azan.

Pigeral: How can my personal fitness problem be compared to a 20% minority problem?

Agniveer: Same as you compared 10 with 1825+.

Pigeral:

Agniveer: why silence?

Pigeral: Look, you can not interfere in the religion of others. India is a multicultural society. Every religion has the same rights.

Agniveer: equal rights? We have the same rights? A Muslim can marry 4 women at a time and divorce them at will. A Hindu is imprisoned for doing the same. Where are the equal rights? And where are equal rights for Muslim women? You only need the same noise rights. And do not you mind the plight of 10 million Muslim women?

Look, equal rights come with the same responsibilities. If you follow the same laws, you will get the same rights. You act like a special hero, your a $$ will be kicked.

And finally, there is another solid difference. There is a strong correlation between the density of Azan and terror. Discover the places on earth where

1. Azan is maximum (let's call it Place 1)
2. Aarti is the maximum (let's call it Place 2)

Then, discover how many of the world's most important terrorist / terrorist organizations place the groups Place 1 and Place 2 groups. That is the last test of fire in which the noise is dangerous and which is harmless.

Pigeral:

Agniveer: why silence?

Pigeral: Who are you man?

Agniveer: a proud Hindu. A proud worshiper of idols. A proud enemy jihadist. A proud Indian. Agniveer is the name.

It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand the religious guidelines, while the leaflet that is being distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a hard copy of a signed appeal by 46 men who believe in religious practices.

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted way just to make some sensationalist headlines. The news about the next singer Nahid Afreen have been prepared without proper investigation and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand the religious guidelines, while the leaflet that is being distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a hard copy of a signed appeal by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first of all, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"THE SIKH GENOCIDE OF 1984

THE VERDICT DELIVERED IN THE CASE NARODA PATIYA IN THE ANTI MUSLIM GUJARAT RIOTS OF 2002 IS WELCOME, BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE SIKH GENOCIDE OF 1984, WHICH HAPPENED AFTER THE ASSASSINATION OF THE INDIAN PRIMARY MINISTER INDIA GANDHI FOR ITS 2 SIKH BODYGUARDS IN RETALIATION FOR THE OPERATION OF BLUESTAR, JUSTICE WILL BE AT THE SAME TIME DELIVERED. Although Indira Gandhi has been rated by you among the biggest Indians, but I do not think she has done anything great to be on this list. We Sikhs do not hold it in high esteem. HOW CAN YOU CALL IT TO A GREAT INDIGENOUS WHEN IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS WITHOUT A SET OF THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT SIKHS WHO ARE A MINORITY COMMUNITY? She only created Bhindranwale to counter the Akalis in Punjab and is responsible for the rise of religious extremism in the state. BEFORE THAT, THERE WAS NO RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM IN PUNJAB. Even after his death, 20,000 Sikhs were murdered throughout India (4,000 in Delhi alone) from October 31 to November 4, 1984 in a cold-blooded genocide led by INDIA'S SECULAR CONRESS PARTY. The Sikhs were burned alive in front of their families, the women were gang raped and their property burned down. The crowds laughed while killing the Sikhs. The thugs were led by the local MPS Congress with lists of government voters in their hands to help them find Sikh homes and properties and were exhorting non-Sikhs to kill as many Sikhs as possible. The local Congress deputies even gave money to the troublemakers by telling them that the person who will kill the maximum number of Sikhs will get the most amount other than other incentives. From October 31 to November 3, shouts of ""KHO BADLA KHOON SE LENGE - WE'RE GOING TO LIVE BLOOD"" were issued in Delhi Doordarshan and even the famous Bollywood actor, Amitabh Bacchan, instigated people to kill the Sikhs. The Congress was in power in the Center at the time of the Riots, and PVNarasimha Rao was the Minister of the Interior, but did not do anything until November 2 despite knowing about the carnage and the Delhi Police only remained as Silent spectators instead of protecting the Sikhs and let the bloody carnage continue according to the instructions of their political masters. Most of the senior police officers deliberately absented from November 1 to 3 following the instructions of their political masters. The army was not deliberately summoned and they were only ordered to attend the night of November 2, but there was still no one to guide them. through the streets of Delhi. Then, on November 3, after its cooling by the blood was satisfied, as by remote control, everything stopped. It was nothing more than a cold-blooded genocide led by the main politicians of the Congress against the Sikhs. If immediate action had been taken on the first day of unrest, this Genocide would never have taken place. IT IS A SUBJECT OF GREAT SHAME FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY WHO YET THE PERPETRATORS OF THE SIKH GENOCIDE 1984 HAVE NOT BEEN ARRESTED OR ANY CORRECT LEGAL CONDEMNMENT TAKEN AGAINST A SIMILAR PERSON ALTHOUGH THE MULTIPLE CONDITIONS IN 2002 POST GIHRA DECREASED LATER THAN DESPITE REPETITIONS OF THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIM.
Assassins and murderers are at liberty and some are even ministers of the ruling governor of Congress. NEITHER ANY ADEQUATE COMPENSATION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE VICTIMS OF THE 84 RIOTS, NOR AN APPROPRIATE APPOLOGY OR ANY MEMORIAL BUILT IN ITS MEMORY BY THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN GIVEN. UNLESS THE AGENTS OF THESE DELINQUENT HEINOS ARE TAKEN TO RESERVE, THEY WILL NOT SURPRISE ME IF THIS MEAT IS RECEIVED. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE CONGRESS IS STILL IN REFUSAL OF THIS LOVING BLOOD, SINCE MANY OF ITS SUPERIOR MINISTERS ARE INVOLVED IN THIS GENOCIDE AND OTHERWISE EMITTING DIFFERENT DISCUSSIONS, WHEN THEY WERE CONVENIENT FOR THEM, THEY HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING. THEY HOPE AGAINST THE HOPE THAT BY LIVING IN DENIAL, THEY CAN MAKE PEOPLE FORGET OF THIS DIFFICULT PHASE OF HISTORY, BUT THEY ARE GROSSLY WRONG, SINCE THE HISTORY NEVER FORGETS THEMSELVES. UNLESS THE GUILTY IS NOT BROUGHT TO RESERVE, IT WILL LEAD TO A VERY FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY GENERATION OF DRUGS AND VIOLENCE.",OAG

2712 central and state security forces in the last decade.

The innocent civilians are killed by the Maoists ... The so-called ""liberals"" never condemned the Maoists ... The organizations of the Maoist Front never uttered a single word against such brutal massacre.

"(Representative image) Thiruvananthapuram: According to an intelligence report presented to the head of state police seven months ago, and accessed by TOI, two ""recognized"" religious conversion centers in Kozhikode and Malappuram converted to Islam 5,793 people between 2011 and 2015. The conversions that happen in centers not recognized in the state could be much higher, fearing the high government officials who, for obvious reasons, did not want to be named. The report indicates that almost half of those who converted to Islam are women, and that the majority of these women (76%) are under 35 years of age. Of the converts, 4,719 were Hindus and the remaining 1,074, mostly Christians. Conversions occurred in Tharbiyathul Islam Sabha in Kozhikode and Monunsthil Islam Sabha in Ponnani, two traditional religious institutions in the state 'authorized' to convert people of other religions to Islam. The police report, prepared in connection with the conversion of Nimisha alias Fathima, currently missing along with 20 other state and suspected of having joined the Islamic State, says that a detailed investigation is required to verify whether these conversions were under duress. they were temptations involved or they were voluntary. ""Inquiries are needed to know if this will affect the communal harmony, the internal security of the state and the nation."" A detailed investigation of SSB (special state branch) in Kasaragod, Kannur, Alappuzha, Thiruvananthapuram and Palakkad is recommended to discover the details, "" The report, sent by Kasaragod SP, to Srinivas, who investigated the Nimisha case in November 2015, said.

"Dear all,,

Thanks for the support.

Consider our last event with the FIA ‚Äã‚Äãin Washington DC.

With trust,
Dr. A Monica Dorhoi
President of the IMF Staff Meditation Club of the World Bank
in Washington DC

[Updated] The meditation club meets with the Foundation of the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) on Monday, January 11, 2016

Newly updated ... Thank you for inviting us, F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) Foundation on Monday, January 11, 2016

Dr. Dorhoi attended on Monday, January 11, 2016 at the reception of the Foundation of the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) at the Marriott Marquis in Washington DC. She has worked for more than 7 years in the financing of road rehabilitation throughout the world. Dr. Dorhoi also works in both financing and risk management in Formula 1 races as part of the different funding requirements.

Thanks to the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) Foundation for preparing and publicizing the progress made in the implementation of the objectives established by the ""Road Safety of the United Nations in 2015"". The report was prepared by the World Health Organization.

At the event, the book ""Objectives for Change, Partners for Action"" was also presented, the 2015 Annual Report of the Foundation of the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA).

The report enthusiastically welcomes the UN Decade of Action for Road Safety and the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN. To be more exact, the energy goals for development were translated into a Global Fuel Economy Initiative in which the foundation is helping governments develop global and regional programs, to find evidence of effectiveness at the national and municipal levels, and to bring donors to support national policies and initiatives.

In the United States, about 40% of traffic-related deaths have been reduced in recent years. The United Nations Millennium Development Goals 2020 in relation to road safety are reducing deaths due to traffic by 50% compared to the current number.

For Dr. Dorhoi, the connection with the Foundation of the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) is blessed by his long dedication to the causes of Ayrton Senna. The F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) is the organizer of the Formula 1 racing championships and Ms. Dorhoi, an American who lives in Washington DC for the past 15 years, has been a great advocate for more than 2 decades . Dr. Dorhoi is one of the greatest admirers of beloved Formula One Racing driver Ayrton Senna who died in 1994 in San Marino. ""The tragedy really marked me in an undeniable way.""

Dr. Dorhoi is also grateful to Alan Prost of France and Williams Renault for sportsmanship after the loss of the pilot Ayrton Senna.

[Additional information: the updated press release was announced at the place of the event].

The statement is published at https://mdorhoi.wordpress.com/2016/03/12/the-meditation-club-meets-with-federation-internationale-de-lautomobile-fiafoundation-on-monday-january-11-2016 /",NAG

Dear Indian Express,

It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand the religious guidelines, while the leaflet that is being distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a hard copy of a signed appeal by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first of all, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"Why India should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty
The Indus Water Treaty is illegal

""According to the documents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jawaharlal Nehru has signed an agreement nowhere for the president of India ...""

""According to the contested agreement, 80% of the water goes to Pakistan, which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India, along with other financial and natural injuries of national interest.""

If we Indians surrender today, our future generations will blame us and never forgive us

India needs to be like China fast and furious and must have the ability to say in the face.
China claims the South China Sea
China made and developed 7 artificial man-made islands in the South China Sea so quickly
So, why can not India stop the water from our own states and territories of the Union of India?
We need to build more dams on the Indus River and we must ask Iccha-Shakti to say a single sentence to the World Bank. F * ck Off
India is scraping the Indus Water Treaty

If China can do for its mother land
So why not India? (If India can not do)

A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand the religious guidelines, while the leaflet that is being distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a hard copy of a signed appeal by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first of all, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"ARUNACHAL PRADESH, INDIA - HIDDEN GATEWAY due to CHINA's need for a sustainable system of riverbank world transport
========================================================================

Arunachal Pradesh of India, the land of the rising sun, the undisputed queen of the beauty of nature and the nerve center of hydroelectric power has always been a bone of contention between India and China.

But why is China so firm to have Arunachal Pradesh as part of Tibet? Is it mere Riligioustic or Geo-political or Military or expansionist mentality of China? Why is China playing a zero-sum game knowing very well that India will not be separated from Arunachal Pradesh at any price?

Undoubtedly it is clear to all that the BASIC GROWTH ENGINE of the Chinese economy has been the SUSTAINABLE RIPARIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEM that has two components as LOCAL AND GLOBAL characteristics.

It is the GLOBAL CHARACTERISTICS that makes ARUNACHAL PRADESH of India through NAGALAND as GATEWAY for China to the SHORTEST RIVER river transport system based on RIO KALADIN of MYANMAR to BENGAL BAY (through Sittwe Sea Port of Myanmar that will form KOLKATA -DHAKA-SITTWE economic corridor driven by 'BANGLADESH-BHUTAN-INDIA-NEPAL MULTILATERAL HIGHWAY' linked with INDIA-MYANMAR-THAILAND TRILATERAL HIGHWAY with which effectively replaces NORTH East of INDIA as HUB of ACT EAST POLICY of INDIA with BENGAL, INDIA) as the current world's riverine transportation system it takes too many times and distances to cover. That is why CHINA continues to challenge the ARUNACHAL PRADESH with what irritates India a lot and prevents both powers from achieving full mutual prosperity.

But this game ZERO-SUM can be reversed by MIGHTY RIVER BRAHMAPUTRA. By having the installation of RORO in DHUBURI and raising the status of DHUBURI, ASSAM, INDIA to the status of INTERNATIONAL SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE, the river brahmaputra can provide a peaceful and sustainable riverine solution to the problem discussed above and for this, both the government of India, like China, must build an economic corridor driven by land, road and rail networks (with both the Government of Bangladesh and Bhutan on board), namely, ""DHAKA-DHUBURI-THIMPHU-LHASA-BEIJING ECONOMIC CORRIDOR ( DDTLB) "".",CAG

Sometimes, it's a group; grandmother, grandfather, mom and dad; so that each of them can do other things while spending a part of the day with the child. Sometimes both parents divide the responsibility. Sometimes, one parent prioritizes work and the other is a full-time caregiver. Sometimes he hires reliable help. No configuration is incorrect. Economic factors also play a role in the decision. What seems a little jarring to me is that it almost seems embarrassing to mothers who work to raise their children as a ""puppy"".

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted way just to make some sensationalist headlines. The news about the next singer Nahid Afreen have been prepared without proper investigation and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand the religious guidelines, while the leaflet that is being distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a hard copy of a signed appeal by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first of all, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"The situation in West Bengal has become terribly communal. I'm from West Bengal. We have witnessed a series of communal riots that take place where most of the Hindus were molested, beaten and Muslim illegal Bangladeshi immigrants looted Hindu residents, shops and religious temple. Hazinagar, malda, chandanagar, dulagarh and a number of places where Hindus are being attacked. We are living under the fear that the Mamma government will give all the support to these evildoers. Bengali's local media is not authorized to show the current situation in West Bengal. We urge the central government to seriously consider the matter or, otherwise, West Bengal will soon become the mini Bangladesh or mini Pakistan. The government of Mumtaz Beghum is arresting any media channel that is trying to transmit these Muslim riots in which they are killing Hindus.

Currently, there is no problem in the correct Kolkata, but conditions in rural and small cities far from Kolkata are changing rapidly.

"Nice to write. However, before concluding that there are no gains in sight, keep your eyes open and look for the gains that are overlooked in this article. 1) This could still be a paradigm shift. Do not forget that the currency has been growing rapidly in our economy. In the words of former RBi governor Subbu Rao, ""it rose 15 percent year-on-year since fiscal year 2015/16, significantly faster than the trend rate of 10.7 percent over the past three years. Electronic transactions do not sufficiently explain this increase in currency demand, suggesting that another dynamic was at stake.The government's surprise move was evidently in response to this unusual expansion of the currency in circulation, clearly out of step with the pace of expansion of the currency. the economic activity "". This trend would definitely be arrested if the government. He is serious and continues his efforts with sincerity. And the economy could see a much smaller cash in circulation. 2) The temporary cash squeeze is pushing many to switch to electronic payments. Comfort and efficiency will keep them away from cash permanently whenever possible. 3) With much less cash in circulation, the black money locked in land and gold would not easily become cash. This could also reduce illegal activities 4) Lower prices of land and departments would eventually benefit the economy 5) All 12lakh crore reported to be returned to the banking system has left a trace. Tax authorities can track them and this could increase the cost of doing business through the parallel economy.",NAG

What you should know about the President of Turkey, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a 64% growth in real GDP and an increase of 43% in GDP per capita.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $ 23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Thus it was stated that Turkey's debt to the IMF was fully paid and announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, the five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.

In 2002, the Central Bank of Turkey had $ 26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $ 92.2 billion in 2011. During the leadership of Erdoƒüan. Inflation fell from 32% to 9% in 2004.

Under the Erdoƒüan government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of highways were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high-speed rail lines were built, and the country's high-speed rail service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railways were built and 5449 km of railway tracks were renovated.

Erdogan invested more in the health system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan increased education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion in 2011, the largest share of the national budget awarded to a ministry and the number of universities in Turkey almost doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012 .

"My life with the family as Er. The businessman has been spoiled due to dubious actions by vengeful officials of corrupt ISI, SBI, KFC, etc.
From 1982 to 1997, they have played with my life as the owner of an SSI unit.
During 1990, I tried justice for ISI and SBI through the Commission of Rejection of Consumer Conflicts of the State of Kerala and in 1992, an appeal filed with National CDRC, both Commissions with Judicial and Non-Judicial Officers found some technical reasons to deny me Justice. I did not have a lawyer to sue my situation. All the members of both Commissions realized the truth, but with the help of the LIMITATION Law. But due to my inexperience and obligation to the system, I kept silent and continued the efforts to revive and rehabilitate my Sick SSI unit with the full cooperation of the Department of Industries.
On 7.7.1995, I paid KFC in One Time Settlement with all the spirit of the KFC letter dated 23.6.95. But my inability to please the corrupt Officials, the unit assumed by the Revenue Recovery Act on 30.5.95 remained with the custody of KFC.
I was at the KFC headquarters, Trivandrum after my OTS payment, until a traffic accident in Palauan on Trivandrum on 6.3.97.
I was under treatment from Medical College Trivandrum, Kannur District Hospital, City Hospital Mangalore, etc. and at least in 1997, I visited KFC HO with the help of crutches, and I noticed that instead of blood, the water flows through the officials and on the same day I visited the CDRC of the State of Kerala and the next day presented a complaint against KFC. After three months, the Commission received a response from KFC with a copy for me. On the basis of KFC's response, the Commission began to issue a Judgment and dismissed my Complaint, directing Sue to the Civil Court.
The next day, I filed a Petition for review in addition to a few others. On the Day of the Hearing, when I stopped with the help of crutches and began to express my point of view, the President of the Commission threatened to pay a huge cost against me. I managed to escape the so-called Consumer Court with fear.
But I still know that anyone who has common sense will grant me justice from the national and state CDRC in both cases.
Then, from 1977 to 2009, he was under acute mental depression.
I started writing to Central and State Governments and spent 5 pages G O, in 2010 I direct KFC to resolve issues at the Board level and I write to several Government Ministries of India to ask and compensate me due to dubious actions by ISI and SBI.
But my efforts continue, the corrupt Officials also continue resisting my efforts at 67 years of age.
What we understand by the synopsis of the difficult situation
Officials have a good salary and support of all government cadres to save the corrupt with the support of the so-called Provision in both judicial and quasi-judicial courts, such as CDRC, Human Rights Commissions, etc.

My situation is covered by Malayalam Manorama, The Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc. and they are in my account of the book of my face.
Should I expect prompt justice from the authorities involved in my last days and that will be illuminated in an effective way for the formation of new security measures for employees on their own and to prevent those bad experiences that I and my family suffer?

"and The Indian Army Band shows up at Drass WHEN WAS THE WAR? The Kargil war, which began in May 1999, was announced after the infiltration of Pakistani troops and Kashmiri militants in the Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir and the Line of Control (LOC). The intrusion into the area, which divided the Indian territory of Ladakh from the northern areas of the state, had been a complete surprise to the Indian army and Operation Vijay was immediately launched to drive our enemies out of the Kargil sector. Pakistani Soldiers MASTERMIND BEHIND THE ATTACK Pervez Musharraf, the then Chief of the Pakistani Army, is said to be the brain box behind the attack. Musharraf carefully traced the intrusion plan, without any details of then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. He was supported and assisted by the General Leutenant Mohammed Aziz. It is said that Musharraf executed the plan, while Atal Bihari Vajpayee had responded to Nawaz Sharif's invitation to Lahore and where the duo signed the Lahore declaration. Conventional modes of warfare WAY OF FIGHT Well equipped with weapons of war, both sides were prepared to launch attacks on each other. The battle of 18,000 feet in the rocky terrain was fought under extremely low temperatures, in a conventional manner, despite the fact that both parties possess nuclear weapons. India placed five infantry divisions, five independent brigades and 44 battalions of paramilitary troops in Kashmir and deployed more than 60 frontline aircraft. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with army and air force officers greet at the Gateway of India in Vijay Diwas. THE AIR FORCE OF INDIA On May 24, 1999, it was decided that the Indian Air Force (IAF) would join the operation. However, it was emphasized that the IAF would not cross the LOC at all costs. The IAF launched bomb attacks against the enemy within its limit. Tiger Hill, one of the highest peaks in the Drass-Kargil area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe state, became the focal point during the war. After a fierce war of more than sixty days, and with the support of the international community, India regained Tiger Hill and pushed Pakistani forces into its territory. Schoolchildren show a national flag on an Indian army tank to commemorate the day. INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO THE CONFLICT The infiltration of Pakistan into India and the military confrontation were deeply criticized by many countries and attracted the intervention of the United States in the crisis. According to a report in the Daily Times, a leading newspaper in Pakistan, India won the confidence of the United States, while Pakistan ""lost its credibility with India and Pakistan."" The international community began to put pressure on Pakistani forces and threatened to withdraw or face isolation. Russia and Israel also came forward to support India's position.

"The 10 most played tricks by the media to control the masses:

1. Project 'everything is fine' in default mode, even if they are not, lulling people into complacency. (routine 'news' damping, sports, celebrity gossip, science, etc.). This technique is used by shepherds that raise sheep for slaughter.

2. Emphasize the individual identity (nationality, religion, state, etc.) to ensure the subconscious separation (the politics of division and rule).

3. Contractile 'voice of the poor' / 'power of protest', etc., although these do not exist. This tricks people into 'thinking' that they are in control.

4. Stage events ('astro turfing', 'shills', 'false witnesses', 'crisis actors', etc.), whether to make 'mass movement', create paranoia or extreme fear, or distract the masses of real problems.

5. Use sports, celebrities and gossip, etc., to deviate from real problems (and mold public opinion).

6. Play key supporting role for large sponsored events of false flag, cheating, etc. (for wars, laws, create fear, distract, etc.) Many of your favorite news anchors and journalists are, in fact, establishment (intelligence) officers.

7. Represent the government as a victim of the crime (trap, assault, etc.), so that the people do not protest later against the draconian laws against themselves.

8. Manufacturing extreme fear, through exaggerated claims of diseases, the power of the enemy, terrorism, etc., (to support wars, desensitize or divide people, for example)

9. The ""media blackout"" (not informing leads to ignorance or dullness) or reporting malevolence (stereotypes or demonization): the most common control technique.

10. Finally, and most reserved, the media are owned by a handful of companies and suppress other sources of information. The media forms the 'matrix' - a network of illusions to deceive the masses, and together with 'politics' are the secret property of banking families.

The next time your favorite news media ""break news,"" ask yourself: ""Is this true, or is this your last cheating / deception / false flag operation""?",OAG

2. There are Israeli citizens who are Muslims. These Israeli Muslim citizens are prohibited from entering 16 Muslim countries. Do any of those people, mentioned above, shout ""islamaphobia"" or ""Muslim ban"" on those countries? Do they protest outside the embassies of those countries? I do not think so.

Perhaps anyone who finds Trump accused of ""islamaphobia"" or a ""Muslim ban"" should be aware of those facts, mentioned above. Maybe you should also know that Trump's executive order is a temporary and non-permanent order like the other 16 countries that have permanent bans.

Only for the further education of those who are being led by George Hitler Soros, here is the list of those countries that prohibit the entry of Israeli citizens:

I smell a little dirt on him. India has a large army presence on the border. How is it that the Pakistani army made a surgical attack? The Indian army had no knowledge of it. How Pakistani came back safely.

Everything happened at a time when the Turkish president was advocating talks on Kashmir ...

For me, India has killed its own army personnel to blame Pakistan and prove that the defense of the Turkish president is wrong.

It also changes the idiotic position that they have taken in secularism (it went extremely to the left under M & C + A legacy of right and left wing leader), it stops damaging the center-state relationship and comes out of the Chinese reverse, its heart is freeze, why? Because I had read about the Gen Kaul that was related to Mr. Nehruji. This model has a serious problem and the country can not be ruined due to the inability to think correctly. b) One regional out and then limited to 10 seats in the next 10 years ...

A few hours ago, the prominent Indian superstar Shah Rukh Khan widely showed his tolerance on Twitter. He blocked a prominent Balochistan leader, Dr. Mahmud Baloch, from following him on Twitter. The reason was simple: he had sent some tweets to Shah Rukh Khan to ask for his support for the burning issue of Baloch in Pakistan.

However, instead of helping or simply ignoring it, SRK, as it is popularly known, chose to put an end point in its virtual media.

The Indus Water Treaty is illegal
The case of the treaty on the waters of the Indus of 1960, has been signed by the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ""nowhere is it stated that such agreement / treaty has been signed on behalf of the President of India"",
""According to the documents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jawaharlal Nehru has signed an agreement nowhere for the president of India ...""

""According to the contested agreement, 80% of the water goes to Pakistan, which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India, along with other financial and natural injuries of national interest.""

If we Indians surrender today, our future generations will blame us and never forgive us

India needs to be like China fast and furious and must have the ability to say in the face.
China claims the South China Sea
China made and developed 7 artificial man-made islands in the South China Sea so quickly
So, why can not India stop the water from our own states and territories of the Union of India?
We need to build more dams on the Indus River and we must ask Iccha-Shakti to say a single sentence to the World Bank. F * ck Off
India is scraping the Indus Water Treaty

If China can do for its mother land
So why not India? (If India can not do)
So, this is a serious problem in our Indian government system with our political parties and also with our useless politician.

291rs by phone. (Shipping 251 + 40rs)
x 6L order per second
= 17.46 cr

I was taking the order until about 12:15 p.m.
That is, 6 hours and 15 minutes, which is 22,500 seconds

17.46 cr per second x 22,500 sec
= 3,92,850 cr

3,88,494 cr was the turnover of the dependency industries in the year 2014-15

That means that within 6 hours and 15 minutes they crossed the billing of the trust

Within 6 seconds, the tax audit applies to that company

And if we calculate the interest on that amount per day

3,92,850 cr x 4% x 1/365 (taking the minimum interest rate)
= 43.05 cr

And if after 4 months they will say that we can not give products and reimburse 291rs to all
43.05 cr x 120 days approx.

A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand the religious guidelines, while the leaflet that is being distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a hard copy of a signed appeal by 46 men who believe in religious practices.

"""ARTICLE 370 DISTURBING INDIA'S SOVEREIGNTY AND INTEGRITY""

Article 370 of the Constitution of India in an article that grants a special status of autonomy to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. (*** means Indian State Jammu and Kashmir).

The article is written in part xx1 of the constitution: temporary, traditional and special provision. (**** means that if the Indian constitution or the Indian Parliament does not accept this provision, then automatically Article 370 is not a valve and is not valid, and is ready to be removed from the Indian Constitution)

Dr. Br. Ambedkar Garu, the principal drafted of the Indian constitution, had refused to draft Article 370. (**** Dr. Br. Ambedkar Garu said that the state of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India , so it is not necessary to have a special autonomy).

Accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India on October 26, 1947, since then it was the Indian State. Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate article 370 of the Indian Constitution for better governance.

I request and tell the Prime Minister of India Respected Narendra Modi please comply with this Article 370 and eliminate it immediately in our Indian Constitution and the state of Jammu and Kashmir wants the Commercial Corridor, the Industrial Axis and the relationship with the States of the South and the North, regarding this issue, please take necessary step and cooperate .....

"Sikhs are a community that loves peace and do not seek criminal retribution against anyone. Our gurus have taught us to help other people in need, regardless of their caste or creed. During the days of Mughals, the Sikhs used to protect Hindu families and their wives from Muslims. All they want from the government is that appropriate and impartial legal measures are taken against the accused in order to instill a certain sense of hope in the families of the victims they have been deprived of for so many years. The government also has to provide adequate money and resettlement options for many of the families of the victims who lost their winners of the genocide and still live in urban ghettos.

THIS INCIDENT HAS REALLY RAISED THE FAITH OF THE SIKH MINORITY COMMUNITY IN THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT AND MANY OF THE AFFECTED FAMILIES HAVE COME OUT OF THE COUNTRY. I remember clearly those fateful days when I was studying at the school in Delhi at that time. For the first time in my life, I felt like a member of a minority community in India. Even now, in Delhi and adjacent areas of the Hindi-speaking cow belt, the Sikhs are subject to racist mockery, humiliation and ridicule because of their unique identity. I was even subjected to these humiliating jokes during my school days in Delhi.

Her only qualification was that she was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru was responsible for the Partition of India. You can read the book written by Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad in case you have any questions.

It is very sad that even 27 years after the massacre of innocent Sikhs that took place between November 1 and 3, 1984 after the death of Indira, justice has not been delivered either to the victims of this atrocious GENOCIDE or to any of their perpetrators (mostly their Goons) have been tested or brought to reserve. According to the BBC, the first 20,000 SIKHS were massacred in broad daylight across India in 4 days and state police (like the Delhi police) did nothing to stop this brutal ETHNIC CLEANSING. They just stood there like silent spectators watching the spooky spectacle that is taking place and, in some cases, even colluding with the perpetrators. It is not possible to commit such a large-scale murder in such a short time without the connivance of local MLAs of Congress (or even Major Congress leaders) who, as in DELHI and elsewhere, incited mobs with vitriolic speeches to kill each Sikh and gave their thugs the lists of voters to help them track the Sikh houses, offered money freely, distributed weapons and offered financial rewards to their thugs to kill the Sikhs since most of these murderers were illiterate. YOUR SUPERIOR MINISTERS LIKE JAGDISH TYTLER AND KAMAL NATH ARE INVOLVED IN THIS GENOCIDE. During this time, the Sikhs were burned alive in front of their families, killed with iron rods, and their women were kidnapped and raped, and their places of worship desecrated. For the Sikh community it was like another HOLOCAUST. More deaths occurred in the states governed by the CONGRESS (obviously). The state police became deaf to the repeated pleas of the affected Sikh families for their protection as the angry crowds continued their grisly act in one Sikh locality after another. In many Sikh localities, entire Sikh communities were annihilated. There are pictures of people laughing as they beat the Sikhs to death.

I was 13 years old in Delhi when this butcher shop took place. I have very vivid and painful memories of those days. I am also a Sikh, but luckily we were safe since our residence was in the cantonment of Delhi, which was a safe area. If I had been in an insecure area, I would have found the same destination. My father picked up me and my sister from our school bus on October 31, 1984, since we had to walk a slight distance to our house. I remember that the whole city was under curfew, between November 1 and 4, 1984 and I did not go to school for a month. A mysterious silence of Death was invading the entire city. For the first time, I felt like someone from the minority community who lives in a country governed by the majority community. I remember seeing black fumes coming from nearby Janakpuri on November 1. We had to install security guards outside our house for a month before things calmed down, although we also threatened phone calls that a crowd also came to our house to kill us.

The Government has only adopted delaying tactics so far (even 27 years after the slaughter) forming committees after committees to investigate this MASS GENOCIDE, despite the repeated testimonies of the families of the Victims in the Court whose near and dear ones were killed in these riots. but unfortunately, THE JUSTICE HAS NOT BEEN DELIVERED UNTIL NOW AND the perpetrators and their thugs are still roaming without restrictions. It is obvious that the Government is trying to protect them and some big names are also involved.

I feel that the Sikh community must present a case at the International Criminal Court in The Hague as the Indian government has failed to do justice to the affected families and until the current government is there, justice will not be done. RETARDED JUSTICE IS DENIED JUSTICE. Until the government of India delivers prompt and effective justice to the victims of the anti-Sikh pogroms of 1984, I would not be surprised if this carnage is repeated again and will remain a DARK CHAPTER IN THE INDIAN HUMAN RIGHTS REGISTRY.",OAG

When the call center was informed that none of them was able to do anything, the call was transferred to the manager and he repeated what the previous types said that ultimately was not useful.
If you change plans, all benefits will be eliminated, such as the free offers of Internet packages that were there. That is the only dispute and they refuse to accept the request for the change of plan between means so that it becomes effective as of the next billing cycle. but it was previously done to remove a package, but it had an effect on the next billing cycle.
Every time they create a problem and we have to suffer. The call center or the voice support is simply useless, since we have to spend our valuable time listening to their nonsense, blah, blah, and repeated automatic messages.

"What you should know about the President of Turkey, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a 64% growth in real GDP and an increase of 43% in GDP per capita.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $ 23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Thus it was stated that Turkey's debt to the IMF was fully paid and announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, the five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.

In 2002, the Central Bank of Turkey had $ 26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $ 92.2 billion in 2011. During the leadership of Erdoƒüan. Inflation fell from 32% to 9% in 2004.

Under the Erdoƒüan government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of highways were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high-speed rail lines were built, and the country's high-speed rail service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railways were built and 5449 km of railway tracks were renovated.

Erdogan invested more in the health system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan increased education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion in 2011, the largest share of the national budget awarded to a ministry and the number of universities in Turkey almost doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012 .

In 1996, 1 ‚Äã‚Äã$ = 222 lire and in 2016 1 $ = 2,94 lire, even after the recent upheaval. Indian cheated by the government of Saffron gay gangsters",NAG

Remember that we only have 4 printers and that we can only print a very limited amount of money per day. We can not print money abroad. People do not have money to spend and businesses are struggling. Countries like America Australia and the United Kingdom took 10 years to move towards digital transactions. It will not happen in one night for the love of God. For a country like India, it will take 10 years to mark my words. the people have died and the whole country is suffering. the worst Idea that I could ever believe, it feels very good with this. he can not even speak in parliament about this.",CAG

"The great myth about taxpayers in India Data of a group of Public Accountants .......
Mr. Jetly said during his speech on the budget that we are very much a tax-compliant society and that only 3.7 million rupees is filling the ITR in this poor country with a population of 125 million rupees.

The response of CAs:

Mr,
We have 82 million voters

- 75% are farmers, 61.5 crores (he exempted them directly, but they can also buy cars, bunglows, etc., as cited ... their political counterparts are also enjoying this)

Balance..........
20.5 crores

Less: 24% BPL class (below the poverty line)

15 crore of population (which is not agricultural or BPL).

Less: Older people, wives who do not work, unemployed youth, people with incomes below taxes ... political class ... (let's say 75%) ... in a typical Indian family, only 1 member who wins and 5 / 6 depend on him ... ..

Balance (15-11.25) = 3.75 crores is the kind of profit ... that ITR can present and ... they are already filling it ...

.... so there are almost no gaps since Mr. Jetly is stressing unnecessarily without knowing his countryü§ìüòùüò±

if Looser Jetly wants more people to enter the tax network ... then ... instead, foolishly resorting to rampant raids, surveys ... warnings ... scrutiny ... demonetizations, etc. terrorism ... he should challenge his negative bureaucrats and .......

1. Introduce a simple income tax on agricultural income in large landowners (say 10 more acres) - you can add 26% of agronomists as taxpayers (politicians are also enjoying this)

2. Instead of introducing fines of 5000/10000 for those who file late IT files ...
Exit with a positive approach and introduce incentives for IT return respondents (learn from Pakistan, IT evaluator gets discount on car purchase)

3. Present the Privilege card to those who pay taxes above a certain limit. Privilege card to grant the right to the assessee with benefits such as priority fee on train tickets, use of airport rooms, subsidized medical facilities, etc. etc ... * allow taxpayers to feel proud *

4. Enter a medical insurance / life insurance on the basis of the average ITR ... as a coverage up to two times of the Gross Income in ITR filled for mediclaim and ten times risk coverage in case of life insurance

5. Introduce the pension after 65 years on the basis of the tax paid by the taxpayer during his working life.

Allow honest taxpayers to obtain certain direct benefits ...

As today, 3.3% of the Indian population is filling the ITR compared to 8% in China ... adding large farmers to the income tax can shoot the figure to more than 10% ... help him cool his tributary terrorism mentality and a nation that complies with taxes ... üòä

I remember how I hated Pakistan and the Pakistanis because they killed my dad, I also hated Muslims because I thought that all Muslims are Pakistani, and when I was 6 years old, I tried to stab a lady in a burkha, because for some strange reason, I thought she was responsible for my father's death, my mother stopped me and made me understand that Pakistan did not kill my father, that the war killed him. I have learned to release my hatred It was not easy, but it is not difficult If I can do it, so can you Today, I am also a soldier, like my father, I fight for peace between India and Pakistan. Because if there was no war between We, my father, would still be here. I'm doing this video because I want the governments of both countries to stop pretending and solving the problem. If France and Germany can make friends after 2 World Wars, if Japan and EE. UU They can leave behind their past and work for progress, why can not we? Most Indians and regular Pakistanis want peace, not war. I am questioning the caliber of the leadership of both nations. We can not dream of becoming a first world country with the leadership of the third world. Please, lift your socks. Talk to each other and do the work. Terrorism sponsored by the state. Enough spies sponsored by the state. Enough hate sponsored by the state. Enough people have died on both sides of the border. Enough is enough.

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted way just to make some sensationalist headlines. The news about the next singer Nahid Afreen have been prepared without proper investigation and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand the religious guidelines, while the leaflet that is being distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a hard copy of a signed appeal by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first of all, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"The situation in West Bengal has become terribly communal. I'm from West Bengal.

Hazinagar, malda, chandanagar, dulagarh and a number of places where Hindus are being attacked. We are living under the fear that the Mamma government will give all the support to these evildoers. Bengali's local media is not authorized to show the current situation in West Bengal. We urge the central government to seriously consider the matter or, otherwise, West Bengal will soon become the mini Bangladesh or mini Pakistan. The government of Mumtaz Beghum is arresting any media channel that is trying to transmit these Muslim riots in which they are killing Hindus.

Currently, there is no problem in the correct Kolkata, but conditions in rural and small cities far from Kolkata are changing rapidly.

"Why India should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty
The Indus Water Treaty is illegal
The case of the treaty on the waters of the Indus of 1960, has been signed by the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ""nowhere is it stated that such agreement / treaty has been signed on behalf of the President of India"",
""According to the documents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jawaharlal Nehru has signed an agreement nowhere for the president of India ...""

""According to the contested agreement, 80% of the water goes to Pakistan, which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India, along with other financial and natural injuries of national interest.""

If we Indians surrender today, our future generations will blame us and never forgive us

India needs to be like China fast and furious and must have the ability to say in the face.
China claims the South China Sea
China made and developed 7 artificial man-made islands in the South China Sea so quickly
So, why can not India stop the water from our own states and territories of the Union of India?
We need to build more dams on the Indus River and we must ask Iccha-Shakti to say a single sentence to the World Bank. F * ck Off
India is scraping the Indus Water Treaty

If China can do for its mother land
So why not India? (If India can not do)
So, this is a serious problem in our Indian government system with our political parties and also with our useless politician.
Who only knows how to bark but can not act.

"What you should know about the President of Turkey, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a 64% growth in real GDP and an increase of 43% in GDP per capita.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $ 23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Thus it was stated that Turkey's debt to the IMF was fully paid and announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, the five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.

In 2002, the Central Bank of Turkey had $ 26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $ 92.2 billion in 2011. During the leadership of Erdoƒüan. Inflation fell from 32% to 9% in 2004.

Under the Erdoƒüan government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of highways were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high-speed rail lines were built, and the country's high-speed rail service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railways were built and 5449 km of railway tracks were renovated.

Erdogan invested more in the health system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan increased education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion in 2011, the largest share of the national budget awarded to a ministry and the number of universities in Turkey almost doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012 .

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted way just to make some sensationalist headlines. The news about the next singer Nahid Afreen have been prepared without proper investigation and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand the religious guidelines, while the leaflet that is being distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a hard copy of a signed appeal by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first of all, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand the religious guidelines, while the leaflet that is being distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a hard copy of a signed appeal by 46 men who believe in religious practices.

The Indian authorities were told that there is an unnecessary exaggeration of the media after the accusations.

prudence is exercised and no measures are taken that could lead to vitiating the environment and affecting peace throughout LOC.

"Sub: - As the attacks of 29/11 can not be stopped without solving the problem of Kashmir that can not be solved without a final game in sight.

----- Throughout the history of humanity will be difficult to find another example in which a country like India [six times more than Pakistan, especially India, with a higher level of progress in science and technology, as is evident in 'Mangal-yan' the mission of Mars] cowardly and impotently tolerates repeated humiliation by means of an armed aggression upon her. India faces such a shameful situation for the simple reason that, like Pakistan (and Bangladesh), India, too foolishly, does not understand that the last word on the partition of India has not yet been written.

One more issue shakes a person like me, born before independence, and that also in the Kota region of my home state of Rajasthan. We were raised in a culture in which a 'Sainik' who sacrificed his life in a war was considered 'Moksha' through 'Veergati' [and told us the stories of Rani Padmini and other ladies of Chittorgarh who became 'Sati' 'because the spouses have' Veergati 'in the battle and Hada Rani (from Kota - Bundi given in marriage to Chittorgarh) cutting off her head and sending it as a souvenir to her' madhosh 'husband to motivate him to fight in the battle against the enemy and Rana Pratap never before to submit to Akabar preferred to live in jungles while fighting incessantly to recover the lost forts and the mother land].

This culture has still been maintained, but today I see the soldiers and their officers dying (not in the war against Pakistan) but as 'keede-makode' (insects) and at the top they are called 'Shaheed' (Martyrs) . Confused if the culture in which we grew up was the right one or the current culture? (where as a Veteran Colonel said after 29/11 on a TV show that after training 3-4 months jihadists under the very nose of the security forces on the border, etc., they come from Pakistan and kill the soldiers well-trained and groomed Indians and their officers in the Army barracks / Corps headquarters)

But in any case, it is time for GOI to realize that the previous Congress Party and now the BJP led by PM Modi and all the other political parties in India have been and are unable to solve the Kashmir problem because of their community mentality. Therefore, before it is too late, GOI should spend a small amount of $ 4,400 for the launch of the 'United India Party', which is the only one that can solve Kashmir and other problems facing India.

It is expected that Friends-of-India will force the Government of India to see the reason explained in:

http://www.alwihdainfo.com/At-least-after-29-11-friends-should-advice-India-to-spend--4400-to-solve-Kashmir-problem_a45603.html

[Especially given the fact that India should not miss this opportunity where some Muslims of Kashmir show courage and patriotism to start working (with flag and board / banner) of the pro-Indian national political party in Srinagar and in other parts of the valley where the the government mandate of J & K and India is not executed and, on the contrary, the separatists supported by Pakistan have been able to inflict almost five months of closure to the people of Kashmir]

Dear Indian Express,

The news about the next singer Nahid Afreen have been prepared without proper investigation and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand the religious guidelines, while the leaflet that is being distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a hard copy of a signed appeal by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first of all, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"Narender Modi is not a messiah as we all used to think, but he is just another corrupt politician who has put on the ""Herald of good days"" mask. The fault is with him. He is not doing anything except making our innocent compatriots look ridiculous. Now let me prove my points.
When Modi would campaign for his BJP party (bhartiye jumla party) in the 2014 general election, he promised that he would solve the case of Naxalitas / Maoists. He promised that he would solve the problem of Kashmir and repeal article 370. He promised that he would solve the problem of OROP for the men of the army. He promised to rebuke Pakistan in the hardest possible way. He promised to give young people a job / a secure career. He promised to protect all women from monsters. He promised to eliminate corruption. He promised to return to make India great ... He promised to bring LokPal ... He promised to bring black money from the Swiss bank ...
But it is ironic that he has done the opposite of what he promised a couple of years ago. He has not fulfilled a single promise that he made to us ... I think he has cheated us all ...
Our jawans are being killed by bloody Naxals / Maoists or by incorrigible Pakistan ... Young people are being deprived of jobs by eliminating many government posts and minimizing the vacancy ... This government is an absolutely anti-government job ... Farmers commit suicide every day. Women are being tortured openly ... Nagaland and Kashmir are demanding freedom and shouting anti-Indian slogans in the JNU of our capital ... China is making CPEC through Gilgit Baltistan without even worrying about our concern.
After all, I ask you what do we have when choosing Mr. Modi? Are not we cheated? Still, we're all happy and we voted for Modi just because a few members of the BJP are speaking out against the Muslims and in support of Ram Mandir ... Are not we stupid? Is hating Muslims the only eligibility that forces us to support BJP?
Please, realize the hard truth that BJP or Modi is not the party or the person we voted for ... We have to change our perception ... Our Jawans on the edge are being mutilated and we are helpless ... I'm ashamed of my PM ...

"Welcome Sir
Be kind enough to make me save my experiences as an independent employment Er. Entrepreneur:
My life with the family as Er. The businessman has been spoiled due to dubious actions by vengeful officials of corrupt ISI, SBI, KFC, etc.
From 1982 to 1997, they have played with my life as the owner of an SSI unit.
During 1990, I tried justice for ISI and SBI through the Commission of Rejection of Consumer Conflicts of the State of Kerala and in 1992, an appeal filed with National CDRC, both Commissions with Judicial and Non-Judicial Officers found some technical reasons to deny me Justice. I did not have a lawyer to sue my situation. All the members of both Commissions realized the truth, but with the help of the LIMITATION Law. But due to my inexperience and obligation to the system, I kept silent and continued the efforts to revive and rehabilitate my Sick SSI unit with the full cooperation of the Department of Industries.
On 7.7.1995, I paid KFC in One Time Settlement with all the spirit of the KFC letter dated 23.6.95. But my inability to please the corrupt Officials, the unit assumed by the Revenue Recovery Act on 30.5.95 remained with the custody of KFC.
I was at the KFC headquarters, Trivandrum after my OTS payment, until a traffic accident in Palauan on Trivandrum on 6.3.97.
I was under treatment from Medical College Trivandrum, Kannur District Hospital, City Hospital Mangalore, etc. and at least in 1997, I visited KFC HO with the help of crutches, and I noticed that instead of blood, the water flows through the officials and on the same day I visited the CDRC of the State of Kerala and the next day presented a complaint against KFC. After three months, the Commission received a response from KFC with a copy for me. On the basis of KFC's response, the Commission began to issue a Judgment and dismissed my Complaint, directing Sue to the Civil Court.
The next day, I filed a Petition for review in addition to a few others. On the Day of the Hearing, when I stopped with the help of crutches and began to express my point of view, the President of the Commission threatened to pay a huge cost against me. I managed to escape the so-called Consumer Court with fear.
But I still know that anyone who has common sense will grant me justice from the national and state CDRC in both cases.
Then, from 1977 to 2009, he was under acute mental depression.
I started writing to Central and State Governments and spent 5 pages G O, in 2010 I direct KFC to resolve issues at the Board level and I write to several Government Ministries of India to ask and compensate me due to dubious actions by ISI and SBI.
But my efforts continue, the corrupt Officials also continue resisting my efforts at 67 years of age.
What we understand by the synopsis of the difficult situation
Officials have a good salary and support of all government cadres to save the corrupt with the support of the so-called Provision in both judicial and quasi-judicial courts, such as CDRC, Human Rights Commissions, etc.

My situation is covered by Malayalam Manorama, The Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc. and they are in my account of the book of my face.
Should I expect prompt justice from the authorities involved in my last days and that will be illuminated in an effective way for the formation of new security measures for employees on their own and to prevent those bad experiences that I and my family suffer?

The following days after the delivery of the car, I noticed some cloudy parts and bubbles in the driver and the passenger door of the car. then I spoke with the dealer about the problem they noticed the problem and I sent my car to the authorized service station of Maruti Suzuki on 02-01-2017 to solve the problem.

After 15 days, the same problem was repeated. When I took my car to the dealership (One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow - 226005) they sent it back to the service station to rectify the problems and they gave me the car after two days.

The same problem was noticed again on 02-13-2017. After only 20 days again, that is, 02/24/17, the same problem has been noticed in the whole body of the car.

When I go back to the dealer's authorized service station, they refused to solve the problem and behaved badly to me.

Today, that is, on 23.03.207 My car is still under repair with Oneup Moters Arambagh of the last 20 days.

A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand the religious guidelines, while the leaflet that is being distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a hard copy of a signed appeal by 46 men who believe in religious practices.

"What you should know about the President of Turkey, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a 64% growth in real GDP and an increase of 43% in GDP per capita.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $ 23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Thus it was stated that Turkey's debt to the IMF was fully paid and announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, the five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.

In 2002, the Central Bank of Turkey had $ 26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $ 92.2 billion in 2011. During the leadership of Erdoƒüan. Inflation fell from 32% to 9% in 2004.

Under the Erdoƒüan government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of highways were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high-speed rail lines were built, and the country's high-speed rail service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railways were built and 5449 km of railway tracks were renovated.

Erdogan invested more in the health system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan increased education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion in 2011, the largest share of the national budget awarded to a ministry and the number of universities in Turkey almost doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012 .

The Hamoodur Rahman Commission established by the Pakistani government after the war noted several atrocities committed by the Pakistani army, including widespread fires and killings in the camp, assassinations of intellectuals and professionals, assassinations of Bengali soldiers and soldiers under the pretext of a riot, killing Bengali civilian, business and industrial officials, raping numerous Bengali women as a deliberate act of vengeance, revenge and torture, deliberate murder of members of the Hindu Bengali minority and the creation of mass graves. [200] The Hamoodur Rahman Commission wrote: ""Indiscriminate killing and looting can only serve the cause of Pakistan's enemies."" In the harshness, we lost the support of the silent majority of the people of East Pakistan ... The massacre of Comilla Cantonment (on 27/28 March 1971) under the orders of the CO 53 Field Regiment, Lieutenant General Yakub Malik, in which 17 Bengali officers and 915 men were killed simply by a swipe of an officer's fingers should be Enough as an example.

Second, I have heard from many non-Muslims who say that Muslims are supposed to kill non-Muslims wherever they are found, although this is a misunderstanding that I want to clarify here; A verse from the Koran was revealed during a war at the time of the Prophet Muhammad in which Muslims were ordered to kill the enemies, but they did not harm the children and women who might be there for some reason. It is also mentioned in several places so as not to start a war before they start to hurt you. Also, this verse was revealed only for that particular time period. There is no verse in the Koran that restricts a Muslim to be a friend of non-Muslims or to kill anyone who is not Muslim. All these are rumors and misinterpretations that make some people sick and start playing hate games.

"Pigeral: If you have problems with Muslim Azan, then you should have a problem with Hindu Aarti as well. Both cause noise pollution.

Agniveer: There is a difference.

1. How many times have you woken up at 4:30 in the morning due to the noise of the Hindu Aarti in the temples? Zero.

How many times have you woken up at 4:30 in the morning due to the noise of Azan in the mosques? 365 times in a year (if you live within a 5 km radius of a mosque).

Zero vs 365 fixes everything.

Even if the Aarti speaker in your town starts at 4:30 at full volume, you can simply go to the priest and he will reduce it. Just try to do it with a Moulvi in ‚Äã‚Äãa mosque and see if you come back in one piece.

Pigeral: Eh, and what about your Ganesh Yatra, Hanuman Yatra? Do not they make noise? Stop them.

Agniveer: How many times in a year do Ganesh Chaturthi and Hanuman Jayanti come?

Pigeral: at least 10 days.

Agniveer: And how many times does Azan happen on the loudspeaker in a year?

Pigeral:

Agniveer: why silence? Let 'me help you. 365 * 5 = 1825. And then, in addition, there are rallies, bike stunts, processions, etc. in Prophet's B'Day, Eid and Muharram, etc.

Then it's 10 vs 1825+. Are 10 and 1825 the same?

Pigeral: The incorrect is wrong. There are no bigger or smaller mistakes.

Agniveer: Ok, your waist size 34/36/38 is also incorrect. Get in shape before commenting on our concerns about Azan.

Pigeral: How can my personal fitness problem be compared to a 20% minority problem?

Agniveer: Same as you compared 10 with 1825+.

Pigeral:

Agniveer: why silence?

Pigeral: Look, you can not interfere in the religion of others. India is a multicultural society. Every religion has the same rights.

Agniveer: equal rights? We have the same rights? A Muslim can marry 4 women at a time and divorce them at will. A Hindu is imprisoned for doing the same. Where are the equal rights? And where are equal rights for Muslim women? You only need the same noise rights. And do not you mind the plight of 10 million Muslim women?

Look, equal rights come with the same responsibilities. If you follow the same laws, you will get the same rights. You act like a special hero, your a $$ will be kicked.

And finally, there is another solid difference. There is a strong correlation between the density of Azan and terror. Discover the places on earth where

1. Azan is maximum (let's call it Place 1)
2. Aarti is the maximum (let's call it Place 2)

Then, discover how many of the world's most important terrorist / terrorist organizations place the groups Place 1 and Place 2 groups.

That is the last test of fire in which the noise is dangerous and which is harmless.

Pigeral:

Agniveer: why silence?

Pigeral: Who are you man?

Agniveer: a proud Hindu. A proud worshiper of idols. A proud enemy jihadist. A proud Indian. Agniveer is the name.

Everything happened at a time when the Turkish president was advocating talks on Kashmir ...

For me, India has killed its own army personnel to blame Pakistan and prove that the defense of the Turkish president is wrong.

"* The first day of Trump in the Oval Office after being elected president. *

First information from the CIA, the Pentagon and the FBI:

Trump: We must destroy ISIS immediately. No delays

CIA: We can not do that, sir. We created them together with Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and others.

Trump: the democrats created them.

CIA: We created ISIS, sir. You need them or you would lose funds from the natural gas lobby.

Trump: Stop financing Pakistan. Let India take care of them.

CIA: We can not do that.

Trump: Why is that?

CIA: India will cut off Balochistan from Pak.

Trump: I do not care.

CIA: India will have peace in Kashmir. They will stop buying our weapons. They will become a superpower. We have to finance Pakistan to keep India occupied in Kashmir.

Trump: But you have to destroy the Taliban.

CIA: Sir, we can not do that. We created the Taliban to keep Russia under control during the 1980s. Now they keep Pakistan occupied and away from its nuclear weapons.

Trump: We have to destroy the sponsoring regimes of terrorism in the Middle East. Let's start with the Saudis.

Pentagon: Sir, we can not do that. We created those regimes because we wanted their oil. We can not have democracy there, otherwise your people will get that oil, and we can not allow their people to own it.

Trump: Then, let's invade Iran.

Pentagon: We can not do that either, sir.

Trump: Why not?

CIA: We're talking to them, sir.

Trump: What? Why?

CIA: We want our Stealth Drones to come back. If we attack them, Russia will devastate us as they did with our friend ISIS in Syria. In addition, we need Iran to keep Israel under control.

Trump: Then let's invade Iraq again.

CIA: Sir, our friends (ISIS) already occupy 1/3 of Iraq.

Trump: Why not all of Iraq?

CIA: We need Iraq's Shia government to keep ISIS under control.

Trump: I am forbidding Muslims to enter the United States.

FBI: We can not do that.

Trump: Why not?

FBI: Then our own population will become intrepid.

Trump: I am deporting all illegal immigrants south of the border.

Border Patrol: You can not do that, sir.

Trump: Why not?

Border Patrol: if they have left, who will build the wall?

Trump: I'm banning H1B visas.

USCIS: You can not do that.

Trump: Why?

Chief of staff: if he does, we will have to outsource White House operations to Bangalore. What is it in India

Trump (sweating profusely for now): What the hell should I do as president?

The Indus Water Treaty is illegal
The case of the treaty on the waters of the Indus of 1960, has been signed by the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ""nowhere is it stated that such agreement / treaty has been signed on behalf of the President of India"",
""According to the documents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jawaharlal Nehru has signed an agreement nowhere for the president of India ...""

""According to the contested agreement, 80% of the water goes to Pakistan, which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India, along with other financial and natural injuries of national interest.""

If we Indians surrender today, our future generations will blame us and never forgive us

India needs to be like China fast and furious and must have the ability to say in the face.
China claims the South China Sea
China made and developed 7 artificial man-made islands in the South China Sea so quickly
So, why can not India stop the water from our own states and territories of the Union of India?
We need to build more dams on the Indus River and we must ask Iccha-Shakti to say a single sentence to the World Bank. F * ck Off
India is scraping the Indus Water Treaty

If China can do for its mother land
So why not India? (If India can not do)
So, this is a serious problem in our Indian government system with our political parties and also with our useless politician.

"Kevin Gaskin We invite you to look at the Bill of Rights, the US Constitution. UU And in the Declaration of Independence, but you will not find anything about ""separation of Church and State"" in any of them.

Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802 to answer a letter from them, asking why he would not proclaim national days of fasting and thanksgiving, as Washington and Adams had done before him. The letter contains the phrase ""wall of separation between church and state,"" which led to the erroneous 'short hand' for the Establishment Clause (US Constitution, Bill of Rights, Amendment I, Article III) that we use today.

""Why do I have freedom of religion ...?"" The answer is in the documents of the Congress regarding our Constitution as we know it today. The process of drafting the First Amendment made the intention of the Founders very clear; Before they approved the final draft, the First Amendment went through almost a dozen different iterations and extensive discussions.

""We do not want in the United States what we had in Britain: we do not want a denomination with the Nation, we will not all be Catholics, Anglicans or any other denomination, we want the principles of God, but we do not want a single denomination managing the Nation"".

This attempt was well understood, as evidenced by the courts' decisions after the First Amendment. In 1799 the court declared: ""By our form of government, the Christian religion is the established religion, and all sects and denominations of Christians are placed on an equal footing.""

One must realize that our Founding Fathers were struggling to achieve ""freedom of religion"" due to the oppressive authority of the Roman Catholic Church. It was not only Great Britain but most of Europe that fell under the astonishing authority of Roman Catholicism. Our Founding Fathers set out to recognize the many denominations of Christianity. In addition, they intended to recognize each denomination equally, instead of granting control power over a single denomination. Here is the misinterpretation of the reckless ""shorthand"" known as ""separation of Church and State.""

A more accurate statement is likely ""separation of denominations of Church and State."" Such an interpretation is fully supported by the documents of the Congress in reference to the declaration: ""We do not want in the United States what we had in Britain: we do not do it"". he wants a denomination running the Nation. Not all of us will be Catholics, Anglicans or any other denomination. We want the principles of God, but we do not want a single denomination managing the Nation "".

Regarding the statement, ""The majority of our founding fathers were agnostics"", that simply is not true. It is a general statement proclaimed by those who oppose religion in general. Yes, there were agnostics in those days, but they were not as frequent as claimed. Thomas Paine was a political activist, philosopher, political theorist and English-American revolutionary. Although he is considered one of our Founding Fathers, he was rejected for his known agnostic beliefs.

John Adams is another wrongly accused of being an agnostic. However, here is a quote from President Adams in reference to Thomas Paine; ""The Christian religion is, over all the religions that once prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, that the Black Guardian Paine says what he wants."" I think you will agree with his words regarding Mr. Paine are more than enough to dispel any claim of their agnostic beliefs.",NAG

""According to the documents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jawaharlal Nehru has signed an agreement nowhere for the president of India ...""

""According to the contested agreement, 80% of the water goes to Pakistan, which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India, along with other financial and natural injuries of national interest.""

If we Indians surrender today, our future generations will blame us and never forgive us

India needs to be like China fast and furious and must have the ability to say in the face.
China claims the South China Sea
China made and developed 7 artificial man-made islands in the South China Sea so quickly
So, why can not India stop the water from our own states and territories of the Union of India?
We need to build more dams on the Indus River and we must ask Iccha-Shakti to say a single sentence to the World Bank. F * ck Off
India is scraping the Indus Water Treaty

If China can do for its mother land
So why not India? (If India can not do)
So, this is a serious problem in our Indian government system with our political parties and also with our useless politician.

"Q1) Is the GDP data distorted?

- Yes they are. They are not accurate. They are being tricked into promoting a lie.

Q2) Can you prove that the GDP data is falsified?

- Until January 2015, India's economy was witnessing its growth since the mid-1980s. And then the magic happened. The Central Bureau of Statistics (CSO) changed the way it calculates GDP by saying that it was necessary to do so taking into account global practices. As a result, India surpassed China and became the fastest growing economy. In 2013-14, our economy grew to 6.9%, instead of 4.7%, which CSO data showed earlier. Even the country's leading economic adviser, Arvind Subramanian, said: ""I am baffled by the new GDP growth numbers."" The revised figures show that GDP growth increased from 4.7% to 5.1% for 2012-13 and from 5% to 6.9% for 2013-14. This means an acceleration in GDP growth of 1.9 percentage points in 2013-14, simply by comparing the new figures over time. "" He also said that ""these figures, especially the acceleration in 2013-14, are at odds with other features of the macroeconomy. Almost all economics experts, working inside or outside the government (including Raghuram Rajan), questioned the GDP figures, since they found that the basic realities reflected a completely opposite picture, the new GDP figures seemed completely in conflict with other economic indicators.According to R Nagraj, an independent member of the subcommittee who examined the new methodology for estimating the product, the version adopted by The Central Stastical Organization differed dramatically from the report finalized by the subcommittee in September 2014.

Q3) What happens with the latest GDP data published after demonetization?

- They are also pretended. Although the performance of some sectors has been better compared to its performance in previous quarters, the great improvement in private consumption (almost double) seems highly doubtful amidst the cash crisis during demonetization. It seems that the CSO has not been able to map the demonetization effect in its data. Both the government and RBI have also been saying (as are some of their sensible critics) that the effect of demonetization can be traced in a longer time frame. In addition, the CSO revised DOWN estimates of Q3 of 2015-16 by 0.3 percentage points to 6.9% from 7.2% previously, which led to a considerable improvement in the Q3 2016-17 figures. For those who do not find it surprising, the CSO revised the UP Q1 and Q2 estimates from 2015-16. This downward revision of T3 of 2015-16 has helped to restrict the effect of demonetization on the figures.

P4) I can not understand anything. Why?

- You can not get it. You are not a statistician or an economist. Whenever reports and complaints like these arise, hurry a bit on the Internet beyond Facebook and Twitter, and read about basic things and what experts have to say about them.

Q5) But Modi ji says that the experts do not know anything. Do not you think he's right?

- After Hindutva, the best tactic Modi ji has is disinformation. He has convinced people to believe that experts do not know anything. He misinforms people who do not know anything, but to believe him. They do not have enough time or will to discover the truth. And when experts question his and he's claims, people never understand what the experts say because they are not educated enough to understand.",CAG

"What you should know about the President of Turkey, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a 64% growth in real GDP and an increase of 43% in GDP per capita.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $ 23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Thus it was stated that Turkey's debt to the IMF was fully paid and announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, the five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.

In 2002, the Central Bank of Turkey had $ 26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $ 92.2 billion in 2011. During the leadership of Erdoƒüan. Inflation fell from 32% to 9% in 2004.

Under the Erdoƒüan government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of highways were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high-speed rail lines were built, and the country's high-speed rail service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railways were built and 5449 km of railway tracks were renovated.

Erdogan invested more in the health system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan increased education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion in 2011, the largest share of the national budget awarded to a ministry and the number of universities in Turkey almost doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012 .

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted way just to make some sensationalist headlines. The news about the next singer Nahid Afreen have been prepared without proper investigation and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand the religious guidelines, while the leaflet that is being distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a hard copy of a signed appeal by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first of all, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

Mr. Jetly said during his speech on the budget that we are very much a tax-compliant society and that only 3.7 million rupees is filling the ITR in this poor country with a population of 125 million rupees.

The response of CAs:

Mr,
We have 82 million voters

- 75% are farmers, 61.5 crores (he exempted them directly, but they can also buy cars, bunglows, etc., as cited ... their political counterparts are also enjoying this)

Balance..........
20.5 crores

Less: 24% BPL class (below the poverty line)

15 crore of population (which is not agricultural or BPL).

Less: Older people, wives who do not work, unemployed youth, people with incomes below taxes ... political class ... (let's say 75%) ... in a typical Indian family, only 1 member who wins and 5 / 6 depend on him ... ..

Balance (15-11.25) = 3.75 crores is the kind of profit ... that ITR can present and ... they are already filling it ...

.... so there are almost no gaps since Mr. Jetly is stressing unnecessarily without knowing his countryü§ìüòùüò±

if Looser Jetly wants more people to enter the tax network ... then ... instead, foolishly resorting to rampant raids, surveys ... warnings ... scrutiny ... demonetizations, etc. terrorism ... he should challenge his negative bureaucrats and .......

1. Introduce a simple income tax on agricultural income in large landowners (say 10 more acres) - you can add 26% of agronomists as taxpayers (politicians are also enjoying this)

2. Instead of introducing fines of 5000/10000 for those who file late IT files ...
Exit with a positive approach and introduce incentives for IT return respondents (learn from Pakistan, IT evaluator gets discount on car purchase)

3. Present the Privilege card to those who pay taxes above a certain limit. Privilege card to grant the right to the assessee with benefits such as priority fee on train tickets, use of airport rooms, subsidized medical facilities, etc. etc ... * allow taxpayers to feel proud *

"Hindus with full support of their religious writings, especially 'MANUSMRITI' have inflicted horrible tortures on their women and untouchable dalits, for centuries ... To promote child rape, girls used to marry old Hindu men, even before puberty ... Polygamy was practiced by most Hindu men, especially Brahmans, such as Tiwaris, Dubeys, Choubeys, etc. ... With religion by their side, some of them used to marry more than 100 Hindu women, even on the deathbed (infamous Antarjali Yatra) ... After the death of old husbands, the newly married baby used to be made 'SATI' by throwing it on her husband's pyre ...
A Bengali film called 'Antarjali Jatra', under the direction of the famous director Goutam Ghose, was released in 1987. This film narrates the prevailing evil practices in Kulin's Brahmanism such as polygamy & ... 'SATI practice', in which a widowed woman recently immolated on her husband's funeral pyre.

All kinds of restrictions used to be imposed on WIDOWS ... on ""food intake"", ""re-marriage of teenage widows"", ""right to property"", ""social status"", ""recreations"" and others, while no restrictions about any kind used to be imposed on WIDOWS!
Now, Hindus are seen mocking the 'Burqa' used by Muslims ... But ask any Hindu, why the devils keep their wives, mothers and grandmothers under the ""GHUNGHAT"" or force their women to wear vermilion (SINDOOR / BINDI), when married Hindus do not use any ... They would be speechless!

Even less the commoner, even the Goddess Sita had to appear for a test of fire to demonstrate her 'purity', she was abandoned by the Hindu god Ramchandra when she was pregnant and forced to live in the Hermitage of Valmiki. Finally, she had to commit suicide ... In the same way, Lord Krishna never married 'Radha' and abandoned her and never saw her again, after leaving Mathura for Dwarka! Although he had 16,100 young wives, in addition to 8 main queens!

I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted way just to make some sensationalist headlines. The news about the next singer Nahid Afreen have been prepared without proper investigation and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand the religious guidelines, while the leaflet that is being distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a hard copy of a signed appeal by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first of all, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).
We await an apology from you for such an error.",CAG
