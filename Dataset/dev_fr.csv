Between freedom of expression and seditious libel in India

BJP dominated by RSS through ABVP attempts to protect their government's intolerable hate politics from #SaditionLaw: The Sedition Act as provided for in Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code, 124-A has been imported from various sources - the Treason Felony Act (operating in Britain)

The fundamental difference between the old Article 124A and the current one is that in the first case, the offense was to excite or attempt to excite feelings of ""disaffection"" as punishable, but in the second, to ""bring"" or try to bring hatred or hate. the contempt of the Government of India ""has also been made punishable.

"Why India should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty
The Indus Water Treaty is illegal
The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 was signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ""nowhere is it said that the said agreement / treaty was signed on behalf of the President of India"" ,
""According to documents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, no disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India ...""

""According to the disputed agreement, 80% of the water goes to Pakistan, which constitutes a serious infringement of the fundamental right of the citizens of India, associated with new financial and natural attacks on the national interest.""

If we Indians continue to give up today, our future generations will want and will never forgive us

India must be like China fast and furious and must have the ability to say on the face.
China Claim the South China Sea
China has made and develops 7 artificial islands made on the South China Sea so quickly
So why India can not stop the water of our own states and territories of the Union of India
We need to build more dam on the Indus River and have to have Iccha-Shakti to say one sentence to the World Bank F * ck Off
India treats Indus water treaty

If China can do for their mother earth
So why not India (if India can not do it)
Then theirs is a serious problem in our system of Indian government with our political parties and also with our useless politician.

"How to convert all your black money into white in 4 perfectly ""legal"" easy steps?
Reply:-
-> Step 1 - Create a political party, and be registered under People's Act Representation, 1951. [Not a difficult task. There are more than 1,000 registered parties that have not even contested Lok Sabha's election in 2014, and EC can not write off a party]
-> Step 2 - Give all your black money to your party in parties, each party should be less than 20,000. You can make infinite donations, and say they come from people.
[According to the 1951 Law on PR, political parties are not required to declare (to the Indian Electoral Commission) the names of individuals or organizations to whom they have received donations of less than 20,000 Rs.]
-> Step 3 - Go to the bank, deposit all that amount into the party's account.
[No need to pay income tax. Political parties are 100% exempt from income tax
-> Step 4 - Remove the amount as and when your needs, in 50/100/500/2000 rupees - Everything is white.
[Since political parties are not under RTI, you can not ask them how they spent their money]
ENJOY YOUR WEALTH ... !!!!
* Moral of the story: - All political parties are the same. All they do is follow the letter of law as in the example above and kill the spirit that is politically correct but ethically incorrect. But in the process you will learn how one can legally generate enormous wealth and still talk about ideals and concerns for the poor.

"a) Karan has neither niece nor nephew who is part of his company. Even aunts / uncles by the way. And in fact, he fed people like Nikhil Advani who does not belong to a filmed family. His team also has a lot of first generation professionals. Shahrukh, Preity Zinta, Sidharth, Anushka, Fawad Khan, to name a few, have been featured in his films in important roles. So the nepotism argument is weak in my opinion.
b) What you must understand too. Karan runs a production house and the nature of the work / hierarchy is very different from that of the usual companies.
c) Karan invests money in a film and, as the creative leader of his company, has the right to give the floor to anyone who suits him and can contribute to the success of his film / attract an audience. And as someone rightly pointed out, it's the talent that stays at the end and if his distribution choice fails to impress the audience, it's his loss and as a man of business in movies, he's smart enough to understand this dynamic.
d) Finally, he has never hesitated to praise the work of foreigners. In fact, he does not hesitate to admit that he is incapable of making certain types of films that he thinks are brilliant and made by foreigners. His friendship with Anurag Kashyap is very strong and Kashyap admitted how badly he had misperceived him like many others until he knew him.",NAG

Do you know how safe you feel when you hear Azan in the morning? The thieves and the doers of evil on the road flee thinking that now the faithful will be standing and on the way to the mosques.

Many people (vendors, beggars, vagrants without distinction of religion) who do not have high-tech mobiles to alert themselves, rely on Azan to wake up in the morning to start their day to eat.
On average, Azan lasts 1 minute 30 seconds. It is a call to prayer for Muslims to wake up and remember God.

1 minutes and 30 seconds, is not it, we are tolerant now? As Indians, we are proud to be rich in culture and religion. If We begin to ban this Azan, Bhajan Kirtan, or the morning song in the gurudwaras, you know how depressing this morning can be.

"Arvind Kejriwal's greatest weapon is his facade of uprightness and moral height, which are often unveiled unveiling his true identity. A large population of Delhi has re-elected this stupid fool because of several factors (the consecutive victories of the BJP and too much Hindutva, including the Gharwapsi, were some of the contributing factors) and not the charismatic personality of this hypocrite. you perceived it that way. His spit-and-run strategy also shows how politically immature this person is. Believe me, this guy never wanted to do anything, he just wanted to be praised and idolized. But why? At least, Modi has a product to sell with a proven track record. What has Kejriwal got, except his persistent allegations (and ironically enough, when he can not even face the same thing against him and his party)?

Yes, it may be true that he is quite daring. But he is as daring as Rakhi Sawant, who both offer new theatrical and dramatic shows to make the general public laugh. If you think he retweeted it because it made more sense, please explain how it made sense to oust Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan. He did it simply because he had no other choice. If Vishwas resigns, Kejriwal, along with Aam Aadmi Party, will probably die, disintegrate and sink into the bottomless abyss of politics that has seen many parties share the same fate. I hope that your leader will propose constructive policies in the future, which will not only benefit him, but also the Indian political scenario.

Dear Indian,
I'm sorry to write that your reporters are there to misinterpret the events and present them in a distorted way just to make sensational headlines.

It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and call.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified lawyer (Mufti) at the request of a person who does not understand the religious guidelines while the booklet that is distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a paper copy an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed on many points and in many dimensions, but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

Shame on him. It does nothing but make fun of our innocent compatriots. Now, let me prove my points. When Modi was campaigning for his BJP party in the 2014 general election, he promised to solve the Naxalite / Maoist case. He promised that he would solve the Kashmir problem and repeal Article 370. He promised that he would solve the problem of OROP for the men of the army. He promised to refute Pakistan in the hardest possible way. He promised to give young people a safe job / career. He promised to protect every woman from monsters. He promised to eliminate corruption. He promised to make India even more beautiful ... He promised to bring LokPal ... He promised to bring back black money from the Swiss bank ... But it's ironic that he has do exactly what he promised a few years ago. He did not even fulfill a single promise he made us ... I was also one of those who were a fan of Mr. Modi but today when I see the state of our country, I feel nervous ... I think He deceived us all ... Our Jawans are killed by bloody Naxals / Maoists or by incorrigible Pakistan. We are deprived of work by abolishing many government positions and minimizing vacancies. This government is absolutely anti-government. ... Farmers commit suicide every day ... Women are tortured openly ... Nagaland and Kashmir call for freedom and shout anti-Indian slogans in the UNJNU of our national capital ... CPEC through Gilgit Baltistan without even taking care of our concern ... I ask you after all we have by electing Mr. Modi? Are we not deceived? Yet we are all happy and voting for Modi just because some BJP members are speaking out against Muslims and in support of Ram Mandir ... Are not we fools? The hatred of Muslims is the only eligibility that forces us to support BJP ?? Please realize the hard truth that BJP or Modi is not the party or the person we voted for.

"What you need to know about the President of Turkey, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 led to a 64% growth in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $ 23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new agreement. Turkey's debt to the IMF was declared fully paid and it announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, Turkey's five-year credit default swaps traded at a record low of 1.17%, lower than that of nine EU member states and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish central bank had reserves of $ 26.5 billion. This amount reached $ 92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's term. Inflation rose from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.

Under the Erdoƒüan government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, 13500 km of motorways were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high-speed rail lines were built and the country's high-speed rail service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railways have been built and 5449 km of renewed railways.

Erdogan has invested more in the health system than any other predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which offers free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan has increased spending on education from 7.5 billion lire in 2002 to 34 billion in 2011, the largest share of the national budget allocated to a ministry, and the number of universities in Turkey having almost doubled from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

In 1996 $ 1 = 222 lire and in 2016 1 $ = 2.94 lire, even after the recent turmoil. GREAT LEADERSHIP",NAG

"So far, the GoI has followed the theme of development through political reforms without giving much thought to the functional reforms of the system. The functional reform of the system requires scanning with a time scale eliminating random authorization or blocking function. The current status reveals that digital India lacks time scale. Moreover, until now, the government of India is defending populist policies, because populism and development do not go hand in hand. And here the GoI found itself in capture position 22 for 2019. Peoples elect the government to lessen their pain and not to lengthen it. Now, if GoI sticks to development, then it has to apply Time Scale as just mentioned with Digital India or if they opt for populism, they will have to drastically reduce the scope of Digital India while the countdown to 2019 has begin. Next 2017 general budget (not 2018 or 2019 due to lack of budget implementation time as original benefits from each budget can be obtained or felt only after 1 & 1/2 years!)

"Why India should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty
The Indus Water Treaty is illegal
The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 was signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ""nowhere is it said that the said agreement / treaty was signed on behalf of the President of India"" ,
""According to documents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, no disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India ...""

""According to the disputed agreement, 80% of the water goes to Pakistan, which constitutes a serious infringement of the fundamental right of the citizens of India, associated with new financial and natural attacks on the national interest.""

If we Indians continue to give up today, our future generations will want and will never forgive us

India must be like China fast and furious and must have the ability to say on the face.
China Claim the South China Sea
China has made and develops 7 artificial islands made on the South China Sea so quickly
So why India can not stop the water of our own states and territories of the Union of India
We need to build more dam on the Indus River and have to have Iccha-Shakti to say one sentence to the World Bank F * ck Off
India treats Indus water treaty

If China can do for their mother earth
So why not India (if India can not do it)
Then theirs is a serious problem in our system of Indian government with our political parties and also with our useless politician.
Who knows just barking but can not take action.
