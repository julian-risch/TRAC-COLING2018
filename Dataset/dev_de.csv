Why then can not India stop the water from our own states and the Union territories of India?

I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines.

It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).
We expect an apology from you for such a mistake.

"How do you convert your total black money into 4 simply perfectly ""legal"" steps in white?
Reply:-
-> Step 1 - Create a political party and register under the representation of the People's Act of 1951. [No difficult task. There are more than 1000 registered parties that did not even attend the 2014 Lok Sabha election, and EC can not deregister a party.]
-> Step 2 - Donate all your black money to your party in parts, each part should be less than 20,000. You can make endless donations and say they are human.
[Under RP Act 1951, political parties are not required to report to the Electoral Commission of India (ECI) the names of persons or organizations from whom they have received donations of less than Rs. 20,000.]
-> Step 3 - Go to the bank and deposit the entire amount in the party's account.
[No need to pay income tax. Political parties are 100% exempt from income tax]
-> Step 4 - Drag the amount as and when you need in 50/100/500/2000 rupee notes - It's all white.
[Since political parties are not on RTI, you can not ask them how they spent their money]
ENJOY YOUR PROSPERITY ... !!!!

b) Whatever you need to understand. Karan runs a production house and the type of work / hierarchy is very different from that of the usual companies.
c) Karan invests money in a film, and as the creative mind of his company, he has the right to engage anyone who can meet the bill and contribute to the success of his film. And as someone rightly pointed out, it's talent that endures in the end and if his choice of cast does not impress the audience, it's his loss and as a businessman in the movies, he's smart enough to understand that dynamic.
d) Finally, he never shied away from praising the work of the outsiders. He also has no qualms admitting that he is unable to make certain films that he considers brilliant and made by outsiders. His friendship with Anurag Kashyap is very strong and Kashyap has admitted how wrong a perception he had about him was just like many others until he met him.",NAG

Do you know how safe it is to hear Azan in the morning? Thieves and evil doers run away, thinking that now the believers are on their way to the mosques.

Many people (sellers, beggars, strays regardless of religions) who have no hi-tech cell phones to sound the alarm rely on Azan waking up in the morning to start their day eating.
On average, Azan lasts 1 minute 30 seconds. This is a call for prayers for Muslims to wake up and remember God.

1 minute and 30 seconds, are we not tolerant of it now? We as Indians boast of being rich in culture and religions. When we start banning this Azan, Bhajan Kirtan, or morning worship in Gurudwaras, you know how depressing our morning could be.

I am a Muslim, and every time I went over Gurudwara in the morning I looked in to admire how they begin their morning singing and meditating. It's so reassuring for the ears. I miss the India, where we admire each other religions!",CAG

His spit-and-run strategy also shows how politically immature this person is. Trust me, this guy never wanted to do anything, he just wanted to be praised and adored. But for what? At least, Modi has a product to sell with a proven track record. What does Kejriwal have besides his stubborn claims (and quite ironically, if he can not even see the same against him and his party)?

Yes, it could be true that he is very daring. But he is as daring as Rakhi Sawant, both of whom develop new theatrical and dramatic elements to make the public laugh. If you think he retweeted it because it was more logical, please explain how logical it was to drive out Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan. He only did it because he had no choice. When Vishwa resigns, Kejriwal, along with the Aam Aadmi party, would likely die, lapse and sink into the bottomless rift of politics, where many parties have experienced a similar fate.

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).

Although Kangana has earned her position, many newcomers have come from outside the industry. SRK never played a ""victim of vows"" card and he governs the industry on his merits. Kangana said something without knowing its true meaning, to which KJ later responded in his personal capacity. Now, people like the author of this article are the ones who play feminist cards and pretend victimization in tabloid journalism. Pathetic!",OAG

Secondly, our corporations, which want a concession for the reduction of corporate tax and excise duty / duty only without competing at comparable standards. Those who challenge these groups can successfully build India. Modi only wanted to see if he broke all conventional approaches to development, but took bold initiatives.

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines.

The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).
We expect an apology from you for such a mistake.",OAG

Shame on him. He does nothing except fool our innocent compatriots. Lie my points now. When Modi was running for his party BJP (bhartiye jumla party) in 2014, he promised he would solve the case of Naxalites / Maoists. He promised that he would solve the Kashmir issue and override Article 370. He promised that he would solve OROP's problem for army men. He promised to refute Pakistan in the hardest way. He has promised that we will give young people a job / a secure career. He promised to protect every woman from monsters. He promised to eliminate corruption. He promised to make India great again. He promised to bring LokPal ... He promised to return black money from the Swiss bank ... But it is ironic that he did exactly as he promised a few years ago. He did not even fulfill a single promise that he made to us ... I was also one of those who were very feared by Mr. Modi, but today, when I see the state of our country, I feel nervous. .. I think he betrayed us all ... Our Jawans are killed by bloody Naxals / Maoists or incorrigible Pakistan. We adolescents are robbed of jobs by scraping many government agencies and minimizing blanks. This government is absolutely anti-government jobs ... Farmers commit suicide every day ... Women are tortured openly ... Nagaland and Kashmir call for freedom and call anti-India slogans in the JNU of our national capital ... China makes CPEC through Gilgit Baltistan, without even worrying about our concerns .. I ask you about everything we have by choosing Mr Modi? Are not we cheated? Nevertheless, we are all happy and voting for Modi just because a few members of BJP speak against Muslims and in support of Ram Mandir ... Are not we idiots ?? Hating Muslims is the only authority that forces us to support BJP? Please recognize the hard truth that either BJP or Modi is not the party or person we voted for.

"What you should know about Turkish President Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused 64% real GDP growth and 43% GDP per capita growth.

Erdoƒüan inherited a $ 23.5 billion debt to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new contract. Turkey's debt to the IMF was therefore declared fully paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, five-year sovereign credit default swaps hit a record low of 1.17%, below the levels of nine EU Member States and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish central bank had reserves of $ 26.5 billion. This amount reached USD 92.2 billion in 2011. During the tour of Erdoƒüan. Inflation fell in 2004 from 32% to 9.0%.

Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, a further 13500 km of motorway were built.

High-speed lines were built for the first time in Turkey's history and the country's high-speed train was put into operation in 2009. In 8 years 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway line renewed.

Erdogan has invested more in the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the Green Card program has been introduced, offering free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan increased spending on education from LR 7.5 billion in 2002 to LR 34 billion in 2011. The highest share of state budget in a ministry and the number of universities in Turkey almost doubled from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

In 1996 1 $ = 222 lira and in 2016 1 $ = 2.94 lira, even after the recent turmoil. THE GREAT GUIDANCE",NAG

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to interpret events wrong and distorted display, just to make some sensational headlines. The news about the upcoming singer Nahid Afreen was prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion that can only be issued by a qualified lawyer (mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand religious guidelines. The leaflet distributed as a fatwa is just a copy of a signed appeal from 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the vocation can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first and foremost an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (fatwa).

"Why should India # ScrapIndusWatersTreaty
Indus Water Contract is illegal
The fall of the Indus Water Treaty of 1960 was signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ""nowhere is it stated that the said agreement / treaty was signed on behalf of the President of India"",
""According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement was signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India ...""

""According to the challenged agreement, 80% of water goes to Pakistan, which is a serious violation of the fundamental right of the citizens of India, coupled with further financial and natural violations of national interest.""

If we Indians stop today, our future generations will blame us and never forgive us

India, like China, has to be fast and furious and have the ability to speak up.
China claim South China Sea
China made and developed 7 artificial artificial islands on the South China Sea so fast
Why then can not India stop the water from our own states and the Union territories of India?
We have to build more dam on the Indus River and have to have Iccha-Shakti saying only one sentence to the World Bank F * ck Off
India shuts up Indus Waters contract

If China can do for her motherland
Then why not India (if India can not)
Then her serious problem is in our Indian government system with our political parties and also with our useless politician.
Who can only bark, but can not act.
