The fundamental difference between the previous Section 124A and the current one is that in the first the offense consisted in exciting or trying to excite the feelings of ""disaffection"" as punishable, but in the second the act of ""bringing or trying to provoke the hatred or contempt of the Government of India ""has also become punishable.

"Why India should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty
The Indus Water Treaty is illegal
The case of the treaty on the waters of the Indus of 1960, has been signed by the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ""nowhere is it stated that such agreement / treaty has been signed on behalf of the President of India"",
""According to the documents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jawaharlal Nehru has signed an agreement nowhere for the president of India ...""

""According to the contested agreement, 80% of the water goes to Pakistan, which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India, along with other financial and natural injuries of national interest.""

If we Indians surrender today, our future generations will blame us and never forgive us

India needs to be like China fast and furious and must have the ability to say in the face.
China claims the South China Sea
China made and developed 7 artificial man-made islands in the South China Sea so quickly
So, why can not India stop the water from our own states and territories of the Union of India?
We need to build more dams on the Indus River and we must ask Iccha-Shakti to say a single sentence to the World Bank. F * ck Off
India is scraping the Indus Water Treaty

If China can do for its mother land
So why not India? (If India can not do)
So, this is a serious problem in our Indian government system with our political parties and also with our useless politician.

"How to turn all your black money into white in 4 perfectly ""legal"" simple steps?
Answer:-
-> Step 1: create a political party and register under the People Representation Act of 1951. [It is not a difficult task. There are more than 1000 registered parties that did not even participate in the 2014 Lok Sabha Election, and EC can not cancel the registration of a match]
-> Step 2: Donate all the black money to your party in parts, each part must be less than 20,000. You can make endless donations and say that they come from people.
[According to the RP Law of 1951, political parties are not obliged to inform (to the Election Commission of India (ECI)) the name of the persons or organizations from which they have received donations for an amount less than Rs .20,000.]
-> Step 3 - Go to the bank, deposit all this amount in the account of the part.
[It is not necessary to pay any income tax. Political parties are 100% exempt from income tax]
-> Step 4: withdraw the amount when you need it, in 50/100/500/2000 rupee notes: everything is white.
[Since Political Parties are not subject to RTI, you can not ask them how they spent their money]
ENJOY YOUR WEALTH ... !!!!
* Moral of the story: - All political parties are the same. All they do is follow the law as the previous example and kill the spirit that is politically correct but ethically incorrect. But in the process, we teach you how you can legally generate enormous wealth and still talk about ideals and concern for poor people.

c) Karan invests money in a film and, as the creative head of his company, he has the right to choose whomever he sees fit and can contribute to the success of his film / attracting the public.

d) Finally, he has never refused to praise the work of outsiders. In fact, he also has no qualms about admitting that he is incapable of making certain kinds of movies that he believes are great and made by strangers.

Do you know how safe it feels when you listen to Azan in the morning? The thieves and the wicked on the way flee thinking that now the faithful will be on their feet and on their way to the mosques.

On average, Azan lasts 1 minute and 30 seconds. That is a call to pray for Muslims to wake up and remember God.

1 minute and 30 seconds, are not we tolerant now? We, as Indians, pride ourselves on being rich in culture and religions. If we begin to forbid this Azan, the bhajan Kirtan, or the morning chant in gurudwaras, you know how depressing our morning can be.

His spitting and running strategy also shows how politically immature this person is. Believe me, this guy never wanted to do anything, just wanted to be praised and idolized. But for what? At least, Modi has a product to sell along with a proven track record. What does Kejriwal have except for his persistent accusations (and in a rather ironic way, when he can not even face the same against him and his party)?

Yes, it could be true that it is quite daring. But he is as bold as Rakhi Sawant, who presents new theatrics and drama to keep the general public laughing. If you think he retweeted it because it was more logical, he explains how logical it was to expel Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan. He did it simply because he had no other choice. If Vishwas withdraws, Kejriwal, along with Aam Aadmi Party, would probably die, decay and sink into the bottomless pit of politics, which has seen many parties share a similar fate.

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted way just to make some sensationalist headlines. The news about the next singer Nahid Afreen have been prepared without proper investigation and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand the religious guidelines, while the leaflet that is being distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a hard copy of a signed appeal by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first of all, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

All schemes of 100,000 lakh crores are declared in each budget, but are poorly implemented through central agencies constituted by non-professional, political, official and intermediary links, which always imagine corruption rather than the success of these schemes. Secondly, our corporate groups, which want a concession of reduced corporate taxes and special taxes / customs duties alone without competition in world standards. Those who challenge these groups can succeed in building India. Modi was only looking if he would break all conventional style development approaches instead of taking bold initiatives.

"Some words from the core of my Heart ... ====================== ========= ==== Narender Modi is not a messiah as we all thought, but he is just another corrupt politician who has put on the mask of the ""Herald of good days"". The fault is with him. He is not doing anything except making our innocent compatriots look ridiculous. Now let me prove my points. When Modi would campaign for his BJP party (bhartiye jumla party) in the 2014 general election, he promised that he would solve the case of Naxalitas / Maoists. He promised that he would solve the problem of Kashmir and repeal article 370. He promised that he would solve the problem of OROP for the men of the army. He promised to rebuke Pakistan in the hardest possible way. He promised to give young people a job / a secure career. He promised to protect all women from monsters. He promised to eliminate corruption. He promised to do great India again ... He promised to bring LokPal ... He promised to bring black money from the Swiss bank ... But it is ironic that he has done the opposite of what he had promised a couple of years ago. He has not fulfilled a single promise that he made to us ... I was also one of those who were Mr. Modi's fan but today, when I see the state of our country, I feel nervous ... I think he has cheated us all. ... Our jawans are being killed by bloody Naxals / Maoists or by incorrigible Pakistan ... Young people are being deprived of jobs by eliminating many government posts and minimizing the vacancy ... This government is absolutely an anti-government job. .. Farmers commit suicide every day ... Women are being tortured openly ... Nagaland and Kashmir demand freedom and shout slogans against India in the JNU of our capital ... China is doing CPEC through Gilgit Baltistan without even worrying about our concern ... After all, I ask you what do we have when choosing Mr. Modi? Are not we cheated? Still, we're all happy and we voted for Modi just because a few members of the BJP are speaking out against the Muslims and in support of Ram Mandir ... Are not we stupid? Is hating Muslims the only eligibility that forces us to support BJP? Please, realize the hard truth that BJP or Modi is not the party or the person we voted for ... We have to change our perception ... Our Jawans on the border are being mutilated and we are helpless ... I am ashamed of my PM ... Jai Hind .....",OAG

"What you should know about the President of Turkey, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a 64% growth in real GDP and an increase of 43% in GDP per capita.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $ 23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $ 0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Thus it was stated that Turkey's debt to the IMF was fully paid and announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, the five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.

In 2002, the Central Bank of Turkey had $ 26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $ 92.2 billion in 2011. During the leadership of Erdoƒüan. Inflation fell from 32% to 9% in 2004.

Under the Erdoƒüan government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of highways were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high-speed rail lines were built, and the country's high-speed rail service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railways were built and 5449 km of railway tracks were renovated.

Erdogan invested more in the health system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan increased education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion in 2011, the largest share of the national budget awarded to a ministry and the number of universities in Turkey almost doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012 .

Dear Indian Express,
I'm sorry to write that your journalists are there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted way just to make some sensationalist headlines. The news about the next singer Nahid Afreen have been prepared without proper investigation and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists do not even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) at the request of someone who can not understand the religious guidelines, while the leaflet that is being distributed and presented as Fatwa is only a hard copy of a signed appeal by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of the appeal can be discussed for many reasons and in many dimensions, but first of all, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

The Indus Water Treaty is illegal
The case of the treaty on the waters of the Indus of 1960, has been signed by the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ""nowhere is it stated that such agreement / treaty has been signed on behalf of the President of India"",
""According to the documents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jawaharlal Nehru has signed an agreement nowhere for the president of India ...""

""According to the contested agreement, 80% of the water goes to Pakistan, which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India, along with other financial and natural injuries of national interest.""

If we Indians surrender today, our future generations will blame us and never forgive us

India needs to be like China fast and furious and must have the ability to say in the face.
China claims the South China Sea
China made and developed 7 artificial man-made islands in the South China Sea so quickly
So, why can not India stop the water from our own states and territories of the Union of India?
We need to build more dams on the Indus River and we must ask Iccha-Shakti to say a single sentence to the World Bank. F * ck Off
India is scraping the Indus Water Treaty

If China can do for its mother land
So why not India? (If India can not do)
